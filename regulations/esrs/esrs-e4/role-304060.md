## Disclosure Requirement E4-6 – Anticipated financial effects from material biodiversity and ecosystem-related risks and opportunities

42. The undertaking shall disclose its anticipated financial effects of material biodiversity- and ecosystem-related risks and opportunities.

43. The information required by paragraph 42 is in addition to the information on current financial effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the reporting period required under ESRS 2 SBM-3 para 48 	- (d).

44. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an understanding of:

	- (a) anticipated financial effects due to material risks arising from biodiversity- and ecosystem-related impacts and dependencies and how these risks have (or could reasonably be expected to have) a material influence on the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short-, medium- and long-term; and

	- (b) anticipated financial effects due to material opportunities related to biodiversity- and ecosystem.

45. The disclosure shall include:

	- (a) a quantification of the anticipated financial effects in monetary terms before considering biodiversity and ecosystems-related actions or where not possible without undue cost or effort, qualitative information. For financial effects arising from material opportunities, a quantification is not required if it would result in disclosure that does not meet the qualitative characteristics of information (see ESRS 1 Appendix B Qualitative characteristics of information). The quantification of the anticipated financial effects in monetary terms may be a single amount or a range;

	- (b) a description of the effects considered, the impacts and dependencies to which they relate and the time horizons in which they are likely to materialize; and

	- (c) the critical assumptions used to quantify the anticipated financial effects as well as the sources and the level of uncertainty of those assumptions.
