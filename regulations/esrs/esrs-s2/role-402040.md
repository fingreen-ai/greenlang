	- (a) actions taken, planned or underway to prevent or mitigate material negative impacts on value chain workers;

	- (b) whether and how it has taken action to provide or enable remedy in relation to an actual material impact;

	- (c) any additional actions or initiatives it has in place with the primary purpose of delivering positive impacts for value chain workers; and

	- (d) how it tracks and assesses the effectiveness of such actions and initiatives in delivering intended outcomes for value chain workers.

33. In relation to paragraph 30, the undertaking shall describe:

	- (a) the processes through which it identifies what action is needed and appropriate in response to a particular actual or potential negative impact on value chain workers;

	- (b) its approach to taking action in relation to specific material negative impacts on value chain workers, including any action in relation to its own purchasing or other internal practices, as well as capacity-building or other forms of engagement with entities in the value chain, or forms of collaborative action with industry peers or other relevant parties; and

	- (c) how it ensures that processes to provide or enable remedy in the event of material negative impacts are available and effective in their implementation and outcomes.

34. In relation to material risks and opportunities, the undertaking shall describe:

	- (a) what action is planned or underway to mitigate material risks for the undertaking arising from its impacts and dependencies on value chain workers and how it tracks effectiveness in practice; and

	- (b) what action is planned or underway to pursue material opportunities for the undertaking in relation to value chain workers.

35. Disclosure of actions to avoid negative impacts

The undertaking shall disclose whether and how it takes action to avoid causing or contributing to material negative impacts on value chain workers through its own practices, including, where relevant, in relation to procurement, sales, and data use. This may include disclosing what approach is taken when tensions arise between the prevention or mitigation of material negative impacts and other business pressures.

36. Disclosure of severe human rights issues

The undertaking shall also disclose whether severe human rights issues and incidents connected to its upstream and downstream value chain have been reported and, if applicable, disclose these. (111)
