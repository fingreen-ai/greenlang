<ol class="arabic simple" start="14">
<li><p>When responding to ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48, the undertaking shall disclose:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) whether and how actual and potential impacts on its own workforce as identified in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities: 	- (i) originate from or are connected to the undertaking’s strategy and business models, and (ii) inform and contribute to adapting the undertaking’s strategy and business model; and</p></li>
<li><p>(b) the relationship between its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on own workforce and its strategy and business model.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When fulfilling the requirements of paragraph 48, the undertaking shall disclose whether all people in its own workforce who could be materially impacted by the undertaking are included in the scope of its disclosure under ESRS 2. These material impacts shall include impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s own operations and its value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. In addition, the undertaking shall provide the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) a brief description of the types of employees and non-employees in its own workforce subject to material impacts by its operations, and specify whether they are employees, self-employed people, or people provided by third party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) In the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either 	- (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the undertaking operates (for example, child labour or forced labour or compulsory labour in specific countries or regions outside the EU), or (ii) related to individual incidents (for example, an industrial accident or an oil spill);</p></li>
<li><p>(c) In the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts, the types of employees and non-employees in its own workforce that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions;</p></li>
<li><p>(d) Any material risks and opportunities for the undertaking arising from impacts and dependencies on its own workforce;</p></li>
<li><p>(e) Any material impacts on its own workforce that may arise from transition plans for reducing negative impacts on the environment and achieving greener and climate-neutral operations, including information on the impacts on own workforce caused by the undertaking’s plans and actions to reduce carbon emissions in line with international agreements. Impacts, risks, and opportunities include restructuring and employment loss as well as opportunities arising from job creation and reskilling or upskilling;</p></li>
<li><p>(f) Operations at significant risk of incidents of forced labour or compulsory labour (87) either in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant); or</p></li>
<li><p>ii. countries or geographic areas with operations considered at risk;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(g) Operations at significant risk of incidents of child labour (88) either in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant); or</p></li>
<li><p>ii. countries or geographic areas with operations considered at risk.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="15">
<li><p>In describing the main types of people in its own workforce who are or could be negatively affected, based on the materiality assessment set out in ESRS 2 IRO 1, the undertaking shall disclose whether and how it has developed an understanding of how people with particular characteristics, those working in particular contexts, or those undertaking particular activities may be at greater risk of harm.</p></li>
<li><p>The undertaking shall disclose which, if any, of its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on people in its own workforce relate to specific groups of people (for example, particular age groups, or people working in a particular factory or country) rather than to all of its own workforce (for example, a general pay cut, or training offered to all people in its own workforce).</p></li>
