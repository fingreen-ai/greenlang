31. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the formal means by which the undertaking’s own workforce can make their concerns and needs known directly to the undertaking and/or through which the undertaking supports the availability of such channels (for example, grievance mechanisms) in the workplace, and how follow up is carried out with the people concerned regarding the issues raised and the effectiveness of these channels.

32. The undertaking shall describe the processes in place to cover the matters defined within paragraph 2 of the Objective section by disclosing the following information:

	- (a) its general approach to and processes for providing or contributing to remedy where it has caused or contributed to a material negative impact on people in its own workforce, including whether and how the undertaking assesses that the remedy provided is effective;
	- (b) any specific channels it has in place for its own workforce to raise their concerns or needs directly with the undertaking and have them addressed, including whether these are established by the undertaking itself and/or through participation in third-party mechanisms;
	- (c) whether or not the undertaking has a grievance/complaints handling mechanism related to employee matters (94); and 
	- (d) the processes through which the undertaking supports the availability of such channels in the workplace of its own workforce; and
	- (e) how it tracks and monitors issues raised and addressed, and, how it ensures the effectiveness of the channels, including through the involvement of stakeholders who are intended users.

33. The undertaking shall disclose whether and how it assesses that people in its own workforce are aware of, and trust, these structures or processes as a way to raise their concerns or needs and have them addressed. In addition, the undertaking shall disclose whether it has policies in place regarding the protection of individuals that use them, including workers’ representatives, against retaliation. If such information has been disclosed in accordance with ESRS G1-1, the undertaking may refer to that information.

34. If the undertaking cannot disclose the above required information because it has not adopted a channel for raising concerns and/or does not support the availability of such a channel in the workplace for its own workforce, it shall disclose this to be the case. It may disclose a timeframe in which it aims to have such a channel in place.
