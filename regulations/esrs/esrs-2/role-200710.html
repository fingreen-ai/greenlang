<li><p>The undertaking shall disclose the following information about the key elements of its general strategy that relate to or affect sustainability matters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) a description of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>significant groups of products and/or services offered, including changes in the reporting period (new/removed products and/or services);</p></li>
<li><p>significant markets and/or customer groups served, including changes in the reporting period (new/removed markets and/or customer groups);</p></li>

<li><p>here applicable and material, products and services that are banned in certain markets;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(b) a breakdown of total revenue, as included in its financial statements, by significant ESRS sectors. When the undertaking provides segment reporting as required by IFRS 8 Operating segments in its financial statements, this sector revenue information shall be, as far as possible, reconciled with IFRS 8 information;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) a list of the additional significant ESRS sectors beyond the ones reflected under paragraph 40(b), such as activities that give rise to intercompany revenues, in which the undertaking develops significant activities, or in which it is or may be connected to material impacts. The identification of these additional ESRS sectors shall be consistent with the way they have been considered by the undertaking when performing its materiality assessment and with the way it discloses material sector-specific information;</p></li>
<li><p>(d) where applicable, a statement indicating, together with the related revenues, that the undertaking is active in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas) sector (16), (i.e., it derives revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, production, processing, storage, refining or distribution, including transportation, storage and trade, of fossil fuels as defined in Article 2, point (62), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council (17)), including a disaggregation of revenues derived from coal, from oil and from gas, as well as the revenues derived from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities related to fossil gas as required under Article 8(7)	- (a) of Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 (18);</p></li>
<li><p>chemicals production (19), i.e., its activities fall under Division 20.2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006;</p></li>

<li><p>(f) an assessment of its current significant products and/or services, and significant markets and customer groups, in relation to its sustainability-related goals; and</p></li>
<li><p>(g) the elements of the undertaking’s strategy that relate to or impact sustainability matters, including the main challenges ahead, critical solutions or projects to be put in place, when relevant for sustainability reporting.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the undertaking is based in an EU Member State that allows for an exemption from the disclosure of the information referred to in Article 18, paragraph 1, sub-point 	- (a) of Directive 2013/34/EU (22), and if the undertaking has made use of that exemption, it may omit the breakdown of revenue by significant ESRS sector required by paragraph 40	- (b). In this case the undertaking shall nevertheless disclose the list of ESRS sectors that are significant for the undertaking.</p></li>
<li><p>The undertaking shall disclose a description of its business model and value chain, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) its inputs and its approach to gathering, developing and securing those inputs;</p></li>

When the undertaking has multiple value chains, the disclosure shall cover the key value chains.</p></li>
