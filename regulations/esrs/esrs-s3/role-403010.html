<h1>Disclosure Requirement S3-1 – Policies related to affected communities<a class="headerlink" href="#disclosure-requirement-s3-1-policies-related-to-affected-communities" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="12">
<li><p>The undertaking shall describe its policies adopted to manage its material impacts on affected communities, as well as associated material risks and opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the extent to which the undertaking has policies that address the identification, assessment, management and/or remediation of material impacts on affected communities specifically, as well as policies that cover material risks or opportunities related to affected communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The disclosure required by paragraph 12 shall contain the information on the undertaking’s policies to manage its material impacts, risks and opportunities related to affected communities in accordance with ESRS 2 MDR-P Policies adopted to manage material sustainability matters. In addition, the undertaking shall specify if such policies cover specific affected communities or all affected communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The undertaking shall disclose any particular policy provisions for preventing and addressing impacts on indigenous peoples.</p></li>
<li><p>The undertaking shall describe its human rights policy commitments (112) that are relevant to affected communities, including those processes and mechanisms to monitor compliance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In its disclosure it shall focus on those matters that are material in relation to (113), as well as its general approach to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) respect for the human rights of communities, and indigenous peoples specifically;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) engagement with affected communities; and</p></li>
<li><p>(c) measures to provide and/or enable remedy for human rights impacts.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The undertaking shall disclose whether and how its policies with regard to affected communities are aligned with internationally recognised standards relevant to communities and indigenous peoples specifically, including the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The undertaking shall also disclose the extent to which cases of non-respect of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises that involve affected communities have been reported in its own operations or in its upstream and downstream value chain and, if applicable, an indication of the nature of such cases (114).</p></li>
<li><p>The policy may take the form of a stand-alone policy regarding communities or be included in a broader document such as a code of ethics or a general sustainability policy that has already been disclosed by the undertaking as part of another ESRS. In those cases, the undertaking shall provide an accurate cross-reference to identify the aspects of the policy that satisfy the requirements of this Disclosure Requirement.</p></li>
