# COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 2023

supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards sustainability reporting standards

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

Having regard to Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, and in particular Article 29b(1), first subparagraph, thereof,

Whereas:

1. Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council, requires large undertakings, small and medium-sized undertakings with securities admitted to trading on the EU regulated markets, as well as parent undertakings of large groups, to include in a dedicated section of their management report or consolidated management report the information necessary to understand the undertaking’s impacts on sustainability matters, and the information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the undertaking’s development, performance and position. Undertakings are to prepare this information in accordance with sustainability reporting standards starting from the financial year indicated in Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 for each category of undertakings.
2. The Commission is required to adopt by 30 June 2023 a first set of standards specifying the information that undertakings are to report in accordance with Article 19a(1) and (2), and Article 29a(1) and (2) of that Directive, including at least the information that financial market participants need in order to comply with the disclosure obligations of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
3. The Commission has taken into account the technical advice provided by the EFRAG. EFRAG’s independent technical advice meets the criteria set out in Article 49(3b), first, second and third subparagraphs, of Directive 2013/34/EU. To ensure proportionality and to facilitate the correct application of the standards by undertakings, the Commission has introduced modifications to EFRAG’s technical advice as regards the materiality approach, the phasing-in of certain requirements, the conversion of certain requirements into voluntary datapoints, the introduction of flexibilities in a number of disclosure requirements, the introduction of technical modifications to ensure coherence with the Union’s legal framework and a high degree of interoperability with global standard-setting initiatives, as well as editorial modifications.
4. These sustainability reporting standards meet the requirements set out in Article 29b of Directive 2013/34/EU.
5. Common sustainability reporting standards should therefore be adopted.
6. In accordance with Article 29b(1), fourth subparagraph, of Directive 2013/34/EU this Regulation should not enter into force earlier than 4 months after its adoption by the Commission. Considering that Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 requires certain categories of undertakings to apply these sustainability reporting standards for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024, this Regulation should enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

# Objective

1. The objective of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) is to specify the sustainability information that an undertaking shall disclose in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Reporting in accordance with ESRS does not exempt undertakings from other obligations laid down in Union law.

2. Specifically, ESRS specify the information that an undertaking shall disclose about its material impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to environmental, social, and governance sustainability matters. ESRS do not require undertakings to disclose any information on environmental, social and governance topics covered by ESRS when the undertaking has assessed the topic in question as non-material (See Appendix E of this Standard “Flowchart for determining disclosures to be included”). The information disclosed in accordance with ESRS enables users of the sustainability statement to understand the undertaking’s material impacts on people and environment and the material effects of sustainability matters on the undertaking’s development, performance and position.

3. The objective of this Standard (ESRS 1) is to provide an understanding of the architecture of ESRS, the drafting conventions and fundamental concepts used, and the general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability information in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464.

# Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions

1.1 Categories of ESRS standards

4. There are three categories of ESRS:

- (a) cross-cutting standards;
- (b) topical standards (Environmental, Social and Governance standards); and
- (c) sector-specific standards.

Cross-cutting standards and topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all undertakings regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking operates in.

5. The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures apply to the sustainability matters covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.

6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.

7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material sustainability matters on the reporting areas governance, strategy, impact, risk and opportunity management, and metrics and targets.

8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively ‘sustainability matters’) covered by topical ESRS.

(1) Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19).

(2) Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (OJ L 322, 16.12.2022, p. 15).
---
# Topical ESRS

Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.

# Sector-specific standards

Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address impacts, risks, and opportunities that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.

# Additional entity-specific disclosures

In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes that an impact, risk, or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks, or opportunities. Application requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.

# Reporting areas and minimum content disclosure requirements on policies, actions, targets, and metrics

The Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2, in topical ESRS, and in sector-specific ESRS are structured into the following reporting areas:

|Reporting Areas|Description|
|---|---|
|Governance (GOV)|The governance processes, controls, and procedures used to monitor, manage, and oversee impacts, risks, and opportunities|
|Strategy (SBM)|How the undertaking’s strategy and business model interact with its material impacts, risks, and opportunities|
|Impact, risk, and opportunity management (IRO)|The process(es) by which the undertaking identifies impacts, risks, and opportunities and assesses their materiality, and manages material sustainability matters through policies and actions|
|Metrics and targets (MT)|The undertaking’s performance, including targets it has set and progress towards meeting them|

# ESRS 2

ESRS 2 includes:

- In section 4.2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements regarding policies (MDR-P) and actions (MDR-A)
- In section 5 Minimum Disclosure Requirements regarding metrics (MDR-M) and targets (MDR-T)

The undertaking shall apply the minimum disclosure requirements regarding policies, actions, metrics, and targets together with the corresponding Disclosure Requirements in topical and sector-specific ESRS.

# Drafting conventions

In all ESRS:

The term “impacts” refers to positive and negative sustainability-related impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s business, as identified through an impact materiality assessment. It refers both to actual impacts and to potential future impacts.
---
# (b) The term “risks and opportunities”

refers to the undertaking’s sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities, including those deriving from dependencies on natural, human and social resources, as identified through a financial materiality assessment (see section 3.5).

Collectively, these are referred to as “impacts, risks and opportunities” (IROs). They reflect the double materiality perspective of ESRS described in section 3.

# 15. Throughout ESRS

the terms that are defined in the glossary of definitions (Annex II) are put in bold italic, except when a defined term is used more than once in the same paragraph.

# 16. ESRS structure the information to be disclosed under Disclosure Requirements.

Each Disclosure Requirement consists of one or more distinct datapoints. The term “datapoint” can also refer to a narrative sub-element of a Disclosure Requirement.

# 17. In addition to Disclosure Requirements most ESRS also contain Application Requirements.

Application Requirements support the application of Disclosure Requirements and have the same authority as other parts of an ESRS.

# 18. ESRS use the following terms to distinguish between different degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose information:

(a) “shall disclose” – indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement or datapoint;

(b) “may disclose” – indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice.

In addition, ESRS use the term “shall consider” when referring to issues, resources or methodologies that the undertaking is expected to take into account or to use in the preparation of a given disclosure if applicable.

# 2. Qualitative characteristics of information

19. When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall apply:

(a) the fundamental qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. relevance and faithful representation; and

(b) the enhancing qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. comparability, verifiability and understandability.

20. These qualitative characteristics of information are defined and described in Appendix B of this Standard.

# 3. Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures

21. The undertaking shall report on sustainability matters based on the double materiality principle as defined and explained in this chapter.

# 3.1 Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process

22. Stakeholders are those who can affect or be affected by the undertaking. There are two main groups of stakeholders:

(a) affected stakeholders: individuals or groups whose interests are affected or could be affected – positively or negatively – by the undertaking’s activities and its direct and indirect business relationships across its value chain;

(b) users of sustainability statements: primary users of general-purpose financial reporting (existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors, including asset managers, credit institutions, insurance undertakings), and other users of sustainability statements, including the undertaking’s business partners, trade unions and social partners, civil society and non-governmental organisations, governments, analysts and academics.
---
# EN

23. Some, but not all, stakeholders may belong to both groups referred to in paragraph 22.

24. Engagement with affected stakeholders is central to the undertaking’s on-going due diligence process (see chapter 4 Due diligence) and sustainability materiality assessment. This includes its processes to identify and assess actual and potential negative impacts, which then inform the assessment process to identify the material impacts for the purposes of sustainability reporting (see section 3.4 of this Standard).

# 3.2 Material matters and materiality of information

25. Performing a materiality assessment (see sections 3.4 Impact materiality and 3.5 Financial materiality) is necessary for the undertaking to identify the material impacts, risks and opportunities to be reported.

26. Materiality assessment is the starting point for sustainability reporting under ESRS. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2, includes general disclosure requirements about the undertaking’s process to identify impacts, risks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2 provides general disclosure requirements on the material impacts, risks and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s materiality assessment.

27. The Application Requirements in Appendix A of this Standard include a list of sustainability matters covered in topical ESRS, categorised by topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics, to support the materiality assessment. Appendix E Flowchart for determining disclosures to be included of this Standard provides an illustration of the materiality assessment described in this section.

28. A sustainability matter is “material” when it meets the criteria defined for impact materiality (see section 3.4 of this Standard) or financial materiality (see section 3.5 of this Standard), or both.

29. Irrespective of the outcome of its materiality assessment, the undertaking shall always disclose the information required by: ESRS 2 General Disclosures (i.e. all the Disclosure Requirements and data points specified in ESRS 2) and the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) in topical ESRS related to the Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 Description of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures.

30. When the undertaking concludes that a sustainability matter is material as a result of its materiality assessment, on which ESRS 2 IRO-1, IRO-2 and SBM-3 set disclosure requirements, it shall:

- (a) disclose information according to the Disclosure Requirements (including Application Requirements) related to that specific sustainability matter in the corresponding topical and sector-specific ESRS;
- (b) disclose additional entity-specific disclosures (see paragraph 11 and AR 1 to AR 5 of this Standard) when the material sustainability matter is not covered by an ESRS or is covered with insufficient granularity.

31. The applicable information prescribed within a Disclosure Requirement, including its datapoints, or an entity-specific disclosure, shall be disclosed when the undertaking assesses, as part of its assessment of material information, that the information is relevant from one or more of the following perspectives:

- (a) the significance of the information in relation to the matter it purports to depict or explain; or
- (b) the capacity of such information to meet the users’ decision-making needs, including the needs of primary users of general-purpose financial reporting described in paragraph 48 and/or the needs of users whose principal interest is in information about the undertaking’s impacts.
---
# 32.

If the undertaking concludes that climate change is not material and therefore omits all disclosure requirements in ESRS E1 Climate change, it shall disclose a detailed explanation of the conclusions of its materiality assessment with regard to climate change (see ESRS 2 IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement), including a forward-looking analysis of the conditions that could lead the undertaking to conclude that climate change is material in the future. If the undertaking concludes that a topic other than climate change is not material and therefore it omits all the Disclosure Requirements in the corresponding topical ESRS, it may briefly explain the conclusions of its materiality assessment for that topic.

# 33.

When disclosing information on policies, actions and targets in relation to a sustainability matter that has been assessed to be material, the undertaking shall include the information prescribed by all the Disclosure Requirements and datapoints in the topical and sector-specific ESRS related to that matter and in the corresponding Minimum Disclosure Requirement on policies, actions, and targets required under ESRS 2. If the undertaking cannot disclose the information prescribed by either the Disclosure Requirements and datapoints in the topical or sector-specific ESRS, or the Minimum Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2 on policies, actions and targets, because it has not adopted the respective policies, implemented the respective actions or set the respective targets, it shall disclose this to be the case and it may report a timeframe in which it aims to have these in place.

# 34.

When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking:

- (a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such information to be material; and
- (b) may omit the information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such information is not needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure Requirement.

# 35.

If the undertaking omits the information prescribed by a datapoint that derives from other EU legislation listed in Appendix B of ESRS 2, it shall explicitly state that the information in question is “not material”.

# 36.

The undertaking shall establish how it applies criteria, including appropriate thresholds, to determine:

- (a) the information it discloses on metrics for a material sustainability matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, in accordance with paragraph 34; and
- (b) the information to be disclosed as entity-specific disclosures.

# 3.3 Double materiality

# 37.

Double materiality has two dimensions, namely: impact materiality and financial materiality. Unless specified otherwise, the terms “material” and “materiality” are used throughout ESRS to refer to double materiality.

# 38.

Impact materiality and financial materiality assessments are inter-related and the interdependencies between these two dimensions shall be considered. In general, the starting point is the assessment of impacts, although there may also be material risks and opportunities that are not related to the undertaking’s impacts. A sustainability impact may be financially material from inception or become financially material, when it could reasonably be expected to affect the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance, cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Impacts are captured by the impact materiality perspective irrespective of whether or not they are financially material.

# 39.

In identifying and assessing the impacts, risks and opportunities in the undertaking’s value chain to determine their materiality, the undertaking shall focus on areas where impacts, risks and opportunities are deemed likely to arise, based on the nature of the activities, business relationships, geographies or other factors concerned.
---
# EN

40. The undertaking shall consider how it is affected by its dependencies on the availability of natural, human and social resources at appropriate prices and quality, irrespective of its potential impacts on those resources.

41. An undertaking’s principal impacts, risks and opportunities are understood to be the same as the material impacts, risks and opportunities identified under the double materiality principle and therefore reported on in its sustainability statement.

42. The undertaking shall apply the criteria set under sections 3.4 and 3.5 in this Standard, using appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds. Appropriate thresholds are necessary to determine which impacts, risks and opportunities are identified and addressed by the undertaking as material and to determine which sustainability matters are material for reporting purposes. Some existing standards and frameworks use the term "most significant impacts” when referring to the threshold used to identify the impacts that are described in ESRS as "material impacts."

# 3.4 Impact materiality

43. A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when it pertains to the undertaking’s material actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on people or the environment over the short-, medium- or long-term. Impacts include those connected with the undertaking’s own operations and upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products and services, as well as through its business relationships. Business relationships include those in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain and are not limited to direct contractual relationships.

44. In this context, impacts on people or the environment include impacts in relation to environmental, social and governance matters.

45. The materiality assessment of a negative impact is informed by the due diligence process defined in the international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. For actual negative impacts, materiality is based on the severity of the impact, while for potential negative impacts it is based on the severity and likelihood of the impact. Severity is based on the following factors:

- (a) the scale;
- (b) scope; and
- (c) irremediable character of the impact.

In the case of a potential negative human rights impact, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.

46. For positive impacts, materiality is based on:

- (a) the scale and scope of the impact for actual impacts; and
- (b) the scale, scope and likelihood of the impact for potential impacts.

# 3.5 Financial materiality

47. The scope of financial materiality for sustainability reporting is an expansion of the scope of materiality used in the process of determining which information should be included in the undertaking’s financial statements.

48. The financial materiality assessment corresponds to the identification of information that is considered material for primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. In particular, information is considered material for primary users of general-purpose financial reports if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that they make on the basis of the undertaking’s sustainability statement.
---
# 49. A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it triggers or could reasonably be expected to trigger material financial effects on the undertaking. This is the case when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have a material influence, or could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the undertaking’s development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Risks and opportunities may derive from past events or future events. The financial materiality of a sustainability matter is not constrained to matters that are within the control of the undertaking but includes information on material risks and opportunities attributable to business relationships beyond the scope of consolidation used in the preparation of financial statements.

# 50. Dependencies on natural, human and social resources can be sources of financial risks or opportunities. Dependencies may trigger effects in two possible ways:

(a) pey may influence pe undertaking’s ability to continue to use or obtain pe resources needed in its business processes, as well as pe quality and pricing of pose resources;
(b) pey may affect pe undertaking’s ability to rely on relationships needed in its business processes on acceptable terms.

# 51. The materiality of risks and opportunities is assessed based on a combination of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential magnitude of the financial effects.

# 52. The undertaking’s materiality assessment may lead to the identification of situations in which its actions to address certain impacts or risks, or to benefit from certain opportunities in relation to a sustainability matter, might have material negative impacts or cause material risks in relation to one or more other sustainability matters. For example:

(a) an action plan to decarbonise production pat involves abandoning certain products might have material negative impacts on pe undertaking’s own workforce and result in material risks due to redundancy payments;
(b) an action plan of an automotive supplier to focus on pe supply of e-vehicles might lead to stranded assets for pe production of supply parts for conventional vehicles.

# 53. In such situations, the undertaking shall:

(a) disclose pe existence of material negative impacts or material risks togeper wip pe actions pat generate pem, wip a cross-reference to pe topic to which pe impacts or risks relate;
(b) provide a description of how pe material negative impacts or material risks are addressed under pe topic to which pey relate.

# 54. When needed for a proper understanding of its material impacts, risks and opportunities, the undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information:

(a) by country, when pere are significant variations of material impacts, risks and opportunities across countries and when presenting pe information at a higher level of aggregation would obscure material information about impacts, risks or opportunities;
(b) by significant site or by significant asset, when material impacts, risks and opportunities are highly dependent on a specific location or asset.

# 55. When defining the appropriate level of disaggregation for reporting, the undertaking shall consider the disaggregation adopted in its materiality assessment. Depending on the undertaking’s specific facts and circumstances, a disaggregation by subsidiary may be necessary.
---
# EN

OJ L, 22.12.2023

56. Where data from different levels, or multiple locations within a level, is aggregated, the undertaking shall ensure that this aggregation does not obscure the specificity and context necessary to interpret the information. The undertaking shall not aggregate material items that differ in nature.

57. When the undertaking presents information disaggregated by sectors, it shall adopt the ESRS sector classification to be specified in a delegated act adopted by the Commission pursuant to article 29b(1) third subparagraph, point (ii), of Directive 2013/34/EU. When a topical or sector-specific ESRS requires that a specific level of disaggregation is adopted in preparing a specific item of information, the requirement in the topical or sector-specific ESRS shall prevail.

4. Due diligence

58. The outcome of the undertaking’s sustainability due diligence process (referred to as “due diligence” in the international instruments mentioned below) informs the undertaking’s assessment of its material impacts, risks and opportunities. ESRS do not impose any conduct requirements in relation to due diligence; nor do they extend or modify the role of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of the undertaking with regard to the conduct of due diligence.

59. Due diligence is the process by which undertakings identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address the actual and potential negative impacts on the environment and people connected with their business. These include negative impacts connected with the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. Due diligence is an on-going practice that responds to and may trigger changes in the undertaking’s strategy, business model, activities, business relationships, operating, sourcing and selling contexts. This process is described in the international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

60. These international instruments identify a number of steps in the due diligence process, including the identification and assessment of negative impacts connected with the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. Where the undertaking cannot address all impacts at once, the due diligence process allows for action to be prioritised based on the severity and likelihood of the impacts. It is this aspect of the due diligence process that informs the assessment of material impacts (see section 3.4 of this Standard). The identification of material impacts also supports the identification of material sustainability risks and opportunities, which are often a product of such impacts.

61. The core elements of due diligence are reflected directly in Disclosure Requirements set out in ESRS 2 and in the topical ESRS, as illustrated below:

(a) embedding due diligence in governance, strategy and business model
i. ESRS 2 GOV-2: Information provided to and sustainability matters addressed by pe undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory bodies;
ii. ESRS 2 GOV-3: Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes; and
iii. ESRS 2 SBM-3: Material impacts, risks and opportunities and peir interaction wip strategy and business model.

UN Guiding Principle 16 and its commentary; UN Interpretive Guide, Questions 21 and 25 as well as OECD Guidelines Chapter II on General Policies (paragraph A.10), and chapter IV on Human Rights (paragraph 4; and paragraph 44 of the Commentary); and OECD Due Diligence Guidance, Section II (1.1 and 1.2) and Annex, Questions 14 and 15.

i. ESRS 2 MDR-M;
ii. ESRS 2 MDR-T; and

# Value chain

# Reporting undertaking and value chain

62. The sustainability statement shall be for the same reporting undertaking as the financial statements. For example, if the reporting undertaking is a parent company required to prepare consolidated financial statements, the sustainability statement will be for the group. This requirement does not apply where the reporting undertaking is not required to draw-up financial statements or where the reporting undertaking is preparing consolidated sustainability reporting pursuant to Article 48i of Directive 2013/34/EU.

63. The information about the reporting undertaking provided in the sustainability statement shall be extended to include information on the material impacts, risks and opportunities connected with the undertaking through its direct and indirect business relationships in the upstream and/or downstream value chain (“value chain information”). In extending the information about the reporting undertaking, the undertaking shall include material impacts, risks and opportunities connected with its upstream and downstream value chain:

- following the outcome of its due diligence process and of its materiality assessment; and
---
# EN

OJ L, 22.12.2023

64. Paragraph 63 does not require information on each and every actor in the value chain, but only the inclusion of material upstream and downstream value chain information. Different sustainability matters can be material in relation to different parts of the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain. The information shall be extended to include value chain information only in relation to the parts of the value chain for which the matter is material.

65. The undertaking shall include material value chain information when this is necessary to:

- (a) allow users of sustainability statements to understand the undertaking’s material impacts, risks and opportunities; and/or
- (b) produce a set of information that meets the qualitative characteristics of information (see Appendix B of this Standard).

66. When determining at which level within its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain a material sustainability matter arises, the undertaking shall use its assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities following the double materiality principle (see chapter 3 of this Standard).

67. When associates or joint ventures, accounted for under the equity method or proportionally consolidated in the financial statements, are part of the undertaking’s value chain, for example as suppliers, the undertaking shall include information related to those associates or joint ventures in accordance with paragraph 63 consistent with the approach adopted for the other business relationships in the value chain. In this case, when determining impact metrics, the data of the associate or joint venture are not limited to the share of equity held, but shall be taken into account on the basis of the impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s products and services through its business relationships.

5.2 Estimation using sector averages and proxies

68. The undertaking’s ability to obtain the necessary upstream and downstream value chain information may vary depending on various factors, such as the undertaking’s contractual arrangements, the level of control that it exercises on the operations outside the consolidation scope and its buying power. When the undertaking does not have the ability to control the activities of its upstream and/or downstream value chain and its business relationships, obtaining value chain information may be more challenging.

69. There are circumstances where the undertaking cannot collect the information about its upstream and downstream value chain as required by paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts to do so. In these circumstances, the undertaking shall estimate the information to be reported about its upstream and downstream value chain, by using all reasonable and supportable information, such as sector-average data and other proxies.

70. Obtaining value chain information could also be challenging in the case of SMEs and other upstream and/or downstream value chain entities that are not in the scope of the sustainability reporting required by Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (see ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances).

71. With reference to policies, actions and targets, the undertaking’s reporting shall include upstream and/or downstream value chain information to the extent that those policies, actions and targets involve actors in the value chain. With reference to metrics, in many cases, in particular for environmental matters for which proxies are available, the undertaking may be able to comply with the reporting requirements without collecting data from the actors in its upstream and downstream value chain, especially from SMEs, for example, when calculating the undertaking’s GHG Scope 3 emissions.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj
---
# 72. The incorporation of estimates made using sector-average data or other proxies shall not result in information that does not meet the qualitative characteristics of information (see chapter 2 and section 7.2 Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty of this Standard).

# 6. Time horizons

# 73. The reporting period for the undertaking’s sustainability statement shall be consistent with that of its financial statements.

# 74. The undertaking shall establish appropriate linkages in its sustainability statement between retrospective and forward-looking information, when relevant, to foster a clear understanding of how historical information relates to future-oriented information.

# 75. A base year is the historical reference date or period for which information is available and against which subsequent information can be compared over time.

# 76. The undertaking shall present comparative information in respect of the base year for amounts reported in the current period when reporting the developments and progress towards a target, unless the relevant Disclosure Requirement already defines how to report progress. The undertaking may also include historical information about achieved milestones between the base year and the reporting period when this is relevant information.

# 77. When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall adopt the following time intervals as of the end of the reporting period:
(a) for the short-term time horizon: the period adopted by the undertaking as the reporting period in its financial statements;
(b) for the medium-term time horizon: from the end of the short-term reporting period defined in (a) up to 5 years;
(c) for the long-term time horizon: more than 5 years.

# 78. The undertaking shall use an additional breakdown for the long-term time horizon when impacts or actions are expected in a period longer than 5 years if necessary to provide relevant information to users of sustainability statements.

# 79. If different definitions of medium- or long-term time horizons are required for specific items of disclosure in other ESRS, the definitions in those ESRS shall prevail.

# 80. There may be circumstances where the use of the medium- or long-term time horizons defined in paragraph 77 results in non-relevant information, as the undertaking uses a different definition for (i) its processes of identification and management of material impacts, risks and opportunities or (ii) the definition of its actions and setting targets. These circumstances may be due to industry-specific characteristics, such as cash flow and business cycles, the expected duration of capital investments, the time horizons over which the users of sustainability statements conduct their assessments or the planning horizons typically used in the undertaking’s industry for decision-making. In these circumstances, the undertaking may adopt a different definition of medium- and/or long-term time horizons (see ESRS 2 BP–2, paragraph 9).

# 81. References to “short-term”, “medium-term”, and “long-term” in ESRS refer to the time horizon as determined by the undertaking according to the provisions in paragraphs 77 to 80.
---
# Preparation and presentation of sustainability information

This chapter provides general requirements to be applied when preparing and presenting sustainability information.

# Presenting comparative information

The undertaking shall disclose comparative information in respect of the previous period for all quantitative metrics and monetary amounts disclosed in the current period. When relevant to an understanding of the current period’s sustainability statement, the undertaking shall also disclose comparative information for narrative disclosures.

When the undertaking reports comparative information that differs from the information reported in the previous period it shall disclose:

- (a) the difference between the figure reported in the previous period and the revised comparative figure; and
- (b) the reasons for the revision of the figure.

Sometimes, it is impracticable to adjust comparative information for one or more prior periods to achieve comparability with the current period. For example, data might not have been collected in the prior period(s) in a way that allows either retrospective application of a new definition of a metric or target, or retrospective restatement to correct a prior period error, and it may be impracticable to recreate the information (see ESRS 2 BP-2). When it is impracticable to adjust comparative information for one or more prior periods, the undertaking shall disclose this fact.

When an ESRS requires the undertaking to present more than one comparative period for a metric or datapoint, the requirements of that ESRS shall prevail.

# Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty

When quantitative metrics and monetary amounts, including upstream and downstream value chain information (see chapter 5 of this Standard), cannot be measured directly and can only be estimated, measurement uncertainty may arise.

An undertaking shall disclose information to enable users to understand the most significant uncertainties affecting the quantitative metrics and monetary amounts reported in its sustainability statement.

The use of reasonable assumptions and estimates, including scenario or sensitivity analysis, is an essential part of preparing sustainability-related information and does not undermine the usefulness of that information, provided that the assumptions and estimates are accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily prevent such an assumption or estimate from providing useful information or meeting the qualitative characteristics of information (see Appendix B of this Standard).

Data and assumptions used in preparing the sustainability statement shall be consistent to the extent possible with the corresponding financial data and assumptions used in the undertaking’s financial statements.

Some ESRS require the disclosure of information such as explanations about possible future events that have uncertain outcomes. In judging whether information about such possible future events is material, the undertaking shall refer to the criteria in Chapter 3 of this Standard and consider:

- (a) the potential financial effects of the events (the possible outcome);
- (b) the severity and likelihood of the impacts on people or the environment resulting from the possible events, taking account of the factors of severity specified in paragraph 45; and
- (c) the full range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes within that range.
---
# 92. When assessing the possible outcomes

The undertaking shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including information about low-probability and high-impact outcomes, which, when aggregated, could become material. For example, the undertaking might be exposed to several impacts or risks, each of which could cause the same type of disruption, such as disruptions to the undertaking’s supply chain. Information about an individual source of risk might not be material if disruption from that source is highly unlikely to occur. However, information about the aggregate risk of supply chain disruption from all sources might be material (see ESRS 2 BP-2).

# 7.3 Updating disclosures about events after the end of the reporting period

In some cases, the undertaking may receive information after the reporting period but before the management report is approved for issuance. If such information provides evidence or insights about conditions existing at period end, the undertaking shall, where appropriate, update estimates and sustainability disclosures, in the light of the new information.

When such information provides evidence or insights about material transactions, other events and conditions that arise after the end of the reporting period, the undertaking shall, where appropriate, provide narrative information indicating the existence, nature and potential consequences of these post-year end events.

# 7.4 Changes in preparation or presentation of sustainability information

The definition and calculation of metrics, including metrics used to set targets and monitor progress towards them, shall be consistent over time. The undertaking shall provide restated comparative figures, unless it is impracticable to do so (see ESRS 2 BP-2), when it has:

- (a) redefined or replaced a metric or target;
- (b) identified new information in relation to the estimated figures disclosed in the preceding period and the new information provides evidence of circumstances that existed in that period.

# 7.5 Reporting errors in prior periods

The undertaking shall correct material prior period errors by restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) disclosed, unless it is impracticable to do so. This requirement does not extend to reporting periods before the first year of application of ESRS by the undertaking.

Prior period errors are omissions from, and misstatements in, the undertaking’s sustainability statement for one or more prior periods. Such errors arise from a failure to use, or misuse of, reliable information that:

- (a) was available when the management report that includes the sustainability statement for those periods was authorised for issuance; and
- (b) could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and considered in the preparation of sustainability disclosures included in these reports.

Such errors include: the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying the definitions for metrics or targets, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.

Potential errors in the current period discovered in that period are corrected before the management report is authorised for issuance. However, material errors are sometimes only discovered in a subsequent period.

When it is impracticable to determine the effect of an error on all prior periods presented, the undertaking shall restate the comparative information to correct the error from the earliest date practicable. When correcting disclosures for a prior period, the undertaking shall not use hindsight either in making assumptions about what the management’s intentions would have been in a prior period or in estimating the amounts disclosed in a prior period. This requirement applies to correction of both backward-looking and forward- looking disclosures.
---
# EN

OJ L, 22.12.2023

101. Corrections of errors are distinguished from changes in estimates. Estimates may need to be revised as additional information becomes known (see ESRS 2 BP-2).

# 7.6 Consolidated reporting and subsidiary exemption

102. When the undertaking is reporting at a consolidated level, it shall perform its assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities for the entire consolidated group, regardless of its group legal structure. It shall ensure that all subsidiaries are covered in a way that allows for the unbiased identification of material impacts, risks and opportunities. Criteria and thresholds for assessing an impact, risk or opportunity as material shall be determined based on chapter 3 of this Standard.

103. Where the undertaking identifies significant differences between material impacts, risks or opportunities at group level and material impacts, risks or opportunities of one or more of its subsidiaries, the undertaking shall provide an adequate description of the impacts, risks and opportunities, as appropriate, of the subsidiary or subsidiaries concerned.

104. When assessing whether the differences between material impacts, risks or opportunities at group level and material impacts, risks or opportunities of one or more of its subsidiaries are significant, the undertaking may consider different circumstances, such as whether the subsidiary or subsidiaries operate in a different sector than the rest of the group or the circumstances reflected in section 3.7 Level of disaggregation.

# 7.7 Classified and sensitive information, and information on intellectual property, know-how or results of innovation

105. The undertaking is not required to disclose classified information or sensitive information, even if such information is considered material.

106. When disclosing information about its strategy, plans and actions, where a specific piece of information corresponding to intellectual property, know-how or the results of innovation is relevant to meet the objective of a Disclosure Requirement, the undertaking may nevertheless omit that specific piece of information if it:
(a) is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question;
(b) has commercial value because it is secret; and
(c) has been subject to reasonable steps by the undertaking to keep it secret.

107. If the undertaking omits classified information or sensitive information, or a specific piece of information corresponding to intellectual property, know-how or the results of innovation because it meets the criteria established in the previous paragraph, it shall comply with the disclosure requirement in question by disclosing all other required information.

108. The undertaking shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that beyond the omission of the classified information or sensitive information, or of the specific piece of information corresponding to intellectual property, know-how or the results of innovation, the overall relevance of the disclosure in question is not impaired.

# 7.8 Reporting on opportunities

109. When reporting on opportunities, the disclosure should consist of descriptive information allowing the reader to understand the opportunity for the undertaking or the entire sector. When reporting on opportunities, the undertaking shall consider the materiality of the information to be disclosed. In this context, it shall consider, among other factors:
(a) whether the opportunity is currently being pursued and is incorporated in its general strategy, as opposed to a general opportunity for the undertaking or the sector;
---
# Structure of the sustainability statement

This chapter provides the basis for the presentation of the information about sustainability matters prepared in compliance with Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (i.e., the sustainability statement) within the undertaking’s management report. Such information is presented in a dedicated section of the management report identified as the sustainability statement. Appendix F Example of structure of ESRS sustainability statement of this Standard provides an illustrative example of a sustainability statement structured according to the requirements of this chapter.

# General presentation requirement

Sustainability information shall be presented:

- (a) in a way that allows a distinction between information required by disclosures in ESRS and other information included in the management report; and
- (b) under a structure that facilitates access to and understanding of the sustainability statement, in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

# Content and structure of the sustainability statement

Except for the possibility to incorporate information by reference in accordance with section 9.1 Incorporation by reference of this Standard, the undertaking shall report all the applicable disclosures required by ESRS in accordance with chapter 1 of this Standard, within a dedicated section of the management report.

The undertaking shall include in its sustainability statement the disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and the Council and to the Commission Delegated Regulations that specify the content and other modalities of those disclosures. The undertaking shall ensure that these disclosures are separately identifiable within the sustainability statement. The disclosures relating to each of the environmental objectives defined in the Taxonomy Regulation shall be presented together in a clearly identifiable part of the environmental section of the sustainability statement. These disclosures are not subject to the provisions of ESRS, with the exception of this paragraph and the first sentence of paragraph 115 of this standard.

When the undertaking includes in its sustainability statement additional disclosures stemming from (i) other legislation which requires the undertaking to disclose sustainability information, or (ii) generally accepted sustainability reporting standards and frameworks, including non-mandatory guidance and sector-specific guidance, published by other standard-setting bodies (such as technical material issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board or the Global Reporting Initiative), such disclosures shall:

- (a) be clearly identified with an appropriate reference to the related legislation, standard or framework (see ESRS 2 BP-2, paragraph 15);
- (b) meet the requirements for qualitative characteristics of information specified in chapter 2 and Appendix B of this standard.

The undertaking shall structure its sustainability statement in four parts, in the following order: general information, environmental information (including disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852), social information and governance information. Respecting the provision in section 3.6 Material impacts or risks arising from actions to address sustainability matters of this Standard, when information provided in one part contains information to be reported in another part, the undertaking may refer in one part to information presented in another part, avoiding duplications. The undertaking may apply the detailed structure illustrated in Appendix F of this Standard.

(8) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).
---
# EN

116. The disclosures required by sector-specific ESRS shall be grouped by reporting area and, where applicable, by sustainability topic. They shall be presented alongside the disclosures required by ESRS 2 and the corresponding topical ESRS.

117. Where the undertaking develops material entity-specific disclosures in accordance with paragraph 11 it shall report those disclosures alongside the most relevant sector-agnostic and sector-specific disclosures.

# 9. Linkages with other parts of corporate reporting and connected information

118. The undertaking shall provide information that enables users of its sustainability statement to understand the connections between different pieces of information in the statement, and the connections between the information in the sustainability statement and other information that the undertaking discloses in other parts of its corporate reporting.

# 9.1 Incorporation by reference

119. Provided that the conditions in paragraph 120 are met, information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement of an ESRS, including a specific datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement, may be incorporated in the sustainability statement by reference to:

- (a) another section of the management report;
- (b) the financial statements;
- (c) the corporate governance statement (if not part of the management report);
- (d) the remuneration report required by Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council;
- (e) the universal registration document, as referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129;
- (f) public disclosures under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (Pillar 3 disclosures). If the undertaking incorporates by reference information from Pillar 3 disclosures, it shall ensure that the information matches the scope of consolidation used for the sustainability statement by complementing the incorporated information with additional elements as necessary.

120. The undertaking may incorporate information by reference to the documents, or part of the documents, listed in paragraph 119, provided that the disclosures incorporated by reference:

- (a) constitute a separate element of information and are clearly identified in the document concerned as addressing the relevant Disclosure Requirement, or the relevant specific datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement;
- (b) are published before or at the same time as the management report;
- (c) are in the same language as the sustainability statement;
- (d) are subject to at least the same level of assurance as the sustainability statement; and
- (e) meet the same technical digitalisation requirements as the sustainability statement.

# 121. Provided that the conditions established in paragraph 120 are met, information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement of an ESRS, including a specific datapoint prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement, may be incorporated in the sustainability statement by reference to the undertaking’s report prepared according to EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) Regulation (EU) No 1221/2009 (12). In this case, the undertaking shall ensure that the information incorporated by reference is produced using the same basis for preparation of ESRS information, including scope of consolidation and treatment of value chain information.

# 122. In the preparation of its sustainability statement using incorporation by reference, the undertaking shall consider the overall cohesiveness of the reported information and ensure that the incorporation by reference does not impair the readability of the sustainability statement. Appendix G Example of incorporation by reference of this Standard is an illustrative example of incorporation by reference (See ESRS 2 BP-2).

# 9.2 Connected information and connectivity with financial statements

# 123. The undertaking shall describe the relationships between different pieces of information. Doing so could require connecting narrative information on governance, strategy and risk management to related metrics and targets. For example, in providing connected information, the undertaking may need to explain the effect or likely effect of its strategy on its financial statements or financial plans, or explain how its strategy relates to metrics and targets used to measure progress against performance. Furthermore, the undertaking may need to explain how its use of natural resources and changes within its supply chain could amplify, change or reduce its material impacts, risks and opportunities. It may need to link this information to information about current or anticipated financial effects on its production costs, to its strategic response to mitigate such impacts or risks, and to its related investment in new assets. The undertaking may also need to link narrative information to the related metrics and targets and to information in the financial statements. Information that describes connections shall be clear and concise.

# 124. When the sustainability statement includes monetary amounts or other quantitative data points that exceed a threshold of materiality and that are presented in the financial statements (direct connectivity between information disclosed in sustainability statement and information disclosed in financial statements), the undertaking shall include a reference to the relevant paragraph of its financial statements where the corresponding information can be found.

# 125. The sustainability statement may include monetary amounts or other quantitative datapoints that exceed a threshold of materiality and that are either an aggregation of, or a part of, monetary amounts or quantitative data presented in the undertaking’s financial statements (indirect connectivity between information disclosed in sustainability statement and information disclosed in financial statements). If this is the case, the undertaking shall explain how these amounts or datapoints in the sustainability statement relate to the most relevant amounts presented in the financial statements. This disclosure shall include a reference to the line item and/or to the relevant paragraphs of its financial statements where the corresponding information can be found. Where appropriate, a reconciliation may be provided, and it may be presented in a tabular form.

# 126. In the case of information not covered by paragraphs 124 and 125, the undertaking shall explain, based on a threshold of materiality, the consistency of significant data, assumptions, and qualitative information included in its sustainability statement with the corresponding data, assumptions and qualitative information included in the financial statements. This may occur when the sustainability statement includes:

- (a) monetary amounts or other quantitative data linked to monetary amounts or other quantitative data presented in the financial statements; or
- (b) qualitative information linked to qualitative information presented in the financial statements.

(12) Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC (OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, p. 1).

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 21/284
---
# Consistency

Consistency as required by paragraph 126 shall be at the level of a single datapoint and shall include a reference to the relevant line item or paragraph of notes to the financial statements. When significant data, assumptions and qualitative information are not consistent, the undertaking shall state that fact and explain the reason.

# Examples

Examples of items for which the explanation in paragraph 126 is required, are:

|(a)|when the same metric is presented as of the reporting date in financial statements and as a forecast for future periods in the sustainability statement;|
|---|---|
|(b)|when macroeconomic or business projections are used to develop metrics in the sustainability statement and they are also relevant in estimating the recoverable amount of assets, the amount of liabilities or provisions in financial statements.|

# Topical and Sector-Specific ESRS

Topical and sector-specific ESRS may include requirements to include reconciliations or to illustrate consistency of data and assumptions for specific Disclosure Requirements. In such cases, the requirements in those ESRS shall prevail.

# Transitional Provisions

# Transitional provision related to entity-specific disclosures

The extent to which sustainability matters are covered by ESRS is expected to evolve as further Disclosure Requirements are developed. Therefore, the need for entity-specific disclosures is likely to decrease over time, in particular as a result of the future adoption of sector-specific standards.

When defining its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking may adopt transitional measures for their preparation in the first three annual sustainability statements under which it may as a priority:

|(a)|introduce in its reporting those entity-specific disclosures that it reported in prior periods, if these disclosures meet or are adapted to meet the qualitative characteristics of information referred to under chapter 2 of this Standard;|
|---|---|
|(b)|complement its disclosures prepared on the basis of the topical ESRS with an appropriate set of additional disclosures to cover sustainability matters that are material for the undertaking in its sector(s), using available best practice and/or available frameworks or reporting standards, such as IFRS industry-based guidance and GRI Sector Standards.|

# Transitional provision related to chapter 5 Value chain

For the first 3 years of the undertaking’s sustainability reporting under the ESRS, in the event that not all the necessary information regarding its upstream and downstream value chain is available, the undertaking shall explain the efforts made to obtain the necessary information about its upstream and downstream value chain, the reasons why not all of the necessary information could be obtained, and its plans to obtain the necessary information in the future.

For the first 3 years of its sustainability reporting under the ESRS, in order to take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in gathering information from actors throughout their value chain and in order to limit the burden for SMEs in the value chain:

|(a)|when disclosing information on policies, actions and targets in accordance with ESRS2 and other ESRS, the undertaking may limit upstream and downstream value chain information to information available in-house, such as data already available to the undertaking and publicly available information;|
|---|---|
|(b)|when disclosing metrics, the undertaking is not required to include upstream and downstream value chain information, except for datapoints derived from other EU legislation, as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix B.|
---
# 134. Paragraphs 132 and 133

apply irrespective of whether or not the relevant actor in the value chain is an SME.

# 135.

Starting from the fourth year of its reporting under the ESRS, the undertaking shall include upstream and/or downstream value chain information according to paragraph 63. In this context, the information required by ESRS to be obtained from SME undertakings in the undertaking’s upstream and/or downstream value chain will not exceed the content of the future ESRS for listed SMEs.

# 10.3 Transitional provision related to section 7.1 Presenting comparative information

# 136.

To ease the first-time application of this Standard, the undertaking is not required to disclose the comparative information required by section 7.1 Presenting comparative information in the first year of preparation of the sustainability statement under the ESRS. For disclosure requirements listed in Appendix C List of phased-in Disclosure Requirements, this transitional provision applies with reference to the first year of mandatory application of the phased-in disclosure requirement.

# 10.4 Transitional provision: List of Disclosure Requirements that are phased-in

# 137.

Appendix C List of phased-in Disclosure Requirements in this Standard sets phase-in provisions for the Disclosure Requirements or datapoints of Disclosure Requirements in ESRS that may be omitted or that are not applicable in the first year(s) of preparation of the sustainability statement under the ESRS.

# Appendix A

# Application Requirements

This appendix is an integral part of ESRS 1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.

# Entity specific disclosures

|AR 1.|The entity-specific disclosures shall enable users to understand the undertaking’s impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to environmental, social or governance matters.|
|---|---|
|AR 2.|When developing entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall ensure that: - (a) the disclosures meet the qualitative characteristics of information as set out in chapter 2 Qualitative characteristics of information; and
- (b) its disclosures include, where applicable, all material information related to the reporting areas of governance; strategy; impact, risk and opportunity management; and metrics and targets (see ESRS 2 chapters 2 to 5).
|
|AR 3.|When determining the usefulness of metrics for inclusion in its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall consider whether: - (a) its chosen performance metrics provide insight into: 1. i. how effective its practices are in reducing negative outcomes and/or increasing positive outcomes for people and the environment (for impacts); and/or
2. ii. the likelihood that its practices result in financial effects on the undertaking (for risks and opportunities);
- (b) the measured outcomes are sufficiently reliable, meaning that they do not involve an excessive number of assumptions and unknowns that would render the metrics too arbitrary to provide a faithful representation; and
- (c) it has provided sufficient contextual information to interpret performance metrics appropriately, and whether variations in such contextual information may impact the comparability of the metrics over time.
|
|AR 4.|When developing its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall carefully consider: - (a) comparability between undertakings, while still ensuring relevance of the information provided, recognising that comparability may be limited for entity-specific disclosures. The undertaking shall consider whether the available and relevant frameworks, initiatives, reporting standards and benchmarks (such as technical material issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board or the Global Reporting Initiative) provide elements that can support comparability to the maximum extent possible; and
- (b) comparability over time: consistency of methodologies and disclosures is a key factor for achieving comparability over time.

|AR 5.|Further guidance for developing entity-specific disclosures can be found by considering the information required under topical ESRS that addresses similar sustainability matters.|

# Double materiality

Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process

AR 6. In addition to the categories of stakeholder listed in paragraph 22, common categories of stakeholders are: employees and other workers, suppliers, consumers, customers, end-users, local communities and persons in vulnerable situations, and public authorities, including regulators, supervisors and central banks.
---
AR 7. Nature may be considered as a silent stakeholder. In this case, ecological data and data on the conservation of species may support the undertaking’s materiality assessment.

AR 8. Materiality assessment is informed by dialogue with affected stakeholders. The undertaking may engage with affected stakeholders or their representatives (such as employees or trade unions), along with users of sustainability reporting and other experts, to provide inputs or feedback on its conclusions regarding its material impacts, risks, and opportunities.

Assessment of impact materiality

AR 9. In assessing impact materiality and determining the material matters to be reported, the undertaking shall consider the following three steps:

- (a) understanding of the context in relation to its impacts including its activities, business relationships, and stakeholders;
- (b) identification of actual and potential impacts (both negative and positive), including through engaging with stakeholders and experts. In this step, the undertaking may rely on scientific and analytical research on impacts on sustainability matters;
- (c) assessment of the materiality of its actual and potential impacts and determination of the material matters. In this step, the undertaking shall adopt thresholds to determine which of the impacts will be covered in its sustainability statement.

Characteristics of severity

AR 10. The severity is determined by the following factors:

- (a) scale: how grave the negative impact is or how beneficial the positive impact is for people or the environment;
- (b) scope: how widespread the negative or positive impacts are. In the case of environmental impacts, the scope may be understood as the extent of environmental damage or a geographical perimeter. In the case of impacts on people, the scope may be understood as the number of people adversely affected; and
- (c) irremediable character: whether and to what extent the negative impacts could be remediated, i.e., restoring the environment or affected people to their prior state.

AR 11. Any of the three characteristics (scale, scope, and irremediable character) can make a negative impact severe. In the case of a potential negative human rights impact, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.

Impacts connected with the undertaking

AR 12. As an illustration:

- (a) if the undertaking uses cobalt in its products that is mined using child labour, the negative impact (i.e., child labour) is connected with the undertaking’s products through the tiers of business relationships in its upstream value chain. These relationships include the smelter and minerals trader and the mining enterprise that uses child labour; and
- (b) if the undertaking provides financial loans to an enterprise for business activities that, in breach of agreed standards, result in the contamination of water and land surrounding the operations, this negative impact is connected with the undertaking through its relationship with the enterprise it provides the loans to.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 25/284
---
# Assessment of financial materiality

AR 13. The following are examples of how impacts and dependencies are sources of risks or opportunities:

- (a) when the undertaking’s business model depends on a natural resource – for example water – it is likely to be affected by changes in the quality, availability and pricing of that resource;
- (b) when the undertaking’s activities result in negative impacts, e.g., on local communities, the activities could become subject to stricter government regulation and/or the impact could trigger consequences of a reputational nature. These might have negative effects on the undertaking’s brand and higher recruitment costs might arise; and
- (c) when the undertaking’s business partners face material sustainability-related risks, the undertaking could be exposed to related consequences as well.

AR 14. The identification of risks and opportunities that affect or could reasonably be expected to affect the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term is the starting point for financial materiality assessment. In this context, the undertaking shall consider:

- (a) the existence of dependencies on natural and social resources as sources of financial effects (see paragraph 50);
- (b) their classification as sources of:

AR 15. Once the undertaking has identified its risks and opportunities, it shall determine which of them are material for reporting. This shall be based on a combination of (i) the likelihood of occurrence and (ii) the potential magnitude of financial effects determined on the basis of appropriate thresholds. In this step it shall consider the contribution of those risks and opportunities to financial effects in the short-, medium- and long-term based on:

- (a) scenarios/forecasts that are deemed likely to materialize; and
- (b) potential financial effects related to sustainability matters deriving either from situations with a below the “more likely than not” threshold or assets/liabilities not, or not yet, reflected in financial statements. This includes:

# Sustainability matters to be included in the materiality assessment

AR 16. When performing its materiality assessment, the undertaking shall consider the following list of sustainability matters covered in the topical ESRS. When, as a result of the undertaking’s materiality assessment (see ESRS 2 IRO-1), a given sustainability matter in this list is assessed to be material, the undertaking shall report according to the corresponding Disclosure Requirements of the relevant topical ESRS. Using this list is not a substitute for the process of determining material matters. This list is a tool to support the undertaking’s materiality assessment. The undertaking still needs to consider its own specific circumstances when determining its material matters. The undertaking, where necessary, also shall develop entity-specific disclosures on material impacts, risks and opportunities not covered by ESRS as described in paragraph 11 of this Standard.

Estimation using sector averages and proxies

AR 17. When the undertaking cannot collect upstream and downstream value chain information as required by paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts to do so, it shall estimate the information to be reported using all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the undertaking at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. This includes, but is not limited to, internal and external information, such as data from indirect sources, sector-average data, sample analyses, market and peer groups data, other proxies or spend-based data.

Content and structure of the sustainability statement

AR 18. As an illustration for paragraph 115 in section 8.2 Content and structure of the sustainability statement of this Standard, the undertaking that covers environmental and social matters in the same policy may cross-refer. That means that the undertaking may report on the policy in its environmental disclosures and cross-refer to it from the relevant social disclosures or vice versa. Consolidated presentation of policies across topics is allowed.

# Appendix B

# Qualitative characteristics of information

This appendix is an integral part of ESRS 1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard. This appendix defines the qualitative characteristics that the information presented in the sustainability statement prepared according to ESRS shall meet.

# Relevance

|QC 1.|Sustainability information is relevant when it may make a difference in the decisions of users under a double materiality approach (see chapter 3 of this Standard).|
|---|---|
|QC 2.|Information may make a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources. Sustainability information may impact decisions of users if it has predictive value, confirmatory value or both. Information has predictive value if it can be used as an input to processes employed by users to predict future outcomes. Sustainability information does not need to be a prediction or forecast to have predictive value, but rather has predictive value if employed by users in making their own predictions.|
|QC 3.|Information has confirmatory value if it provides feedback about (confirms or changes) previous evaluations.|
|QC 4.|Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information relates, as assessed in the context of the undertaking’s sustainability reporting (see chapter 3 of this Standard).|

# Faithful representation

|QC 5.|To be useful, the information must not only represent relevant phenomena, it must also faithfully represent the substance of the phenomena that it purports to represent. Faithful representation requires information to be (i) complete, (ii) neutral and (iii) accurate.|
|---|---|
|QC 6.|A complete depiction of an impact, a risk or an opportunity includes all material information necessary for the users to understand that impact, risk or opportunity. This includes how the undertaking has adapted its strategy, risk management and governance in response to that impact, risk or opportunity, as well as the metrics identified to set targets and measure performance.|
|QC 7.|A neutral depiction is without bias in its selection or disclosure of information. Information is neutral if it is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipulated to make it more likely that the users will receive that information favourably or unfavourably. It shall be balanced, so as to cover favourable/positive and unfavourable/negative aspects. Both negative and positive material impacts from an impact materiality perspective as well as material risks and opportunities from a financial materiality perspective shall receive equal attention. Any aspirational sustainability information, for example targets or plans, shall cover both aspirations and factors that could prevent the undertaking from achieving these aspirations in order to have a neutral depiction.|
|QC 8.|Neutrality is supported by the exercise of prudence which is the exercise of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty. Information shall not be netted or compensated to be neutral. The exercise of prudence means that opportunities are not overstated and risks are not understated. Equally, the exercise of prudence does not allow for the understatement of opportunities or the overstatement of risks. The undertaking may present net information, in addition to gross values, if such presentation does not obscure relevant information and includes a clear explanation about the effects of the netting and the reasons for the netting.|
---
# QC 9. Information Accuracy

Information can be accurate without being perfectly precise in all respects. Accurate information implies that the undertaking has implemented adequate processes and internal controls to avoid material errors or misstatements. Estimates should be presented with an emphasis on their limitations and associated uncertainty. The level of precision needed and attainable depends on the nature of the information and the matters it addresses. Accuracy includes:

- (a) Factual information free from material error
- (b) Precise descriptions
- (c) Clearly identified estimates, approximations, and forecasts
- (d) No material errors in selecting and applying processes for estimates, with reasonable and supportable inputs
- (e) Reasonable assertions based on quality and quantity of information
- (f) Information about future judgments reflecting both the judgments and the underlying information

# Comparability

Sustainability information is comparable when it can be compared within previous periods of the undertaking and with information from other undertakings, especially those with similar activities or in the same industry. Comparability can be achieved through targets, baselines, industry benchmarks, or information from recognized organizations.

# Consistency

Consistency involves using the same approaches or methods for sustainability matters from period to period within the undertaking and across other undertakings. Consistency aids in achieving comparability.

# Verifiability

Verifiability enhances user confidence in the completeness, neutrality, and accuracy of information. Sustainability information is verifiable when the information itself or its inputs can be corroborated. Verifiability includes:

(a) Corroborating information by comparing it with other available data
(b) Providing details on inputs and calculation methods for estimates
(c) Information reviewed and agreed upon by relevant bodies
---
# EN

OJ L, 22.12.2023

|QC 15.|Some sustainability information will be in the form of explanations or forward-looking information. Those disclosures can be supportable by faithfully representing on a factual basis for example the strategies, plans and risk analyses of the undertaking. To help users decide whether to use such information, the undertaking shall describe the underlying assumptions and methods of producing the information, as well as other factors that provide evidence that it reflects the actual plans or decisions made by the undertaking.|
|---|---|
|QC 16.|Sustainability information is understandable when it is clear and concise. Understandable information enables any reasonably knowledgeable user to readily comprehend the information being communicated.|
|QC 17.|For sustainability disclosures to be concise, they need to (a) avoid generic “boilerplate” information, which is not specific to the undertaking; (b) avoid unnecessary duplication of information, including information also provided in financial statements; and (c) use clear language and well-structured sentences and paragraphs. Concise disclosures shall only include material information. Complementary information presented pursuant to paragraph 113 shall be provided in a way that avoids obscuring material information.|
|QC 18.|Clarity might be enhanced by distinguishing information about developments in the reporting period from “standing” information that remains relatively unchanged from one period to the next. This can be done, for example, by separately describing features of the undertaking’s sustainability-related governance and risk management processes that have changed since the previous reporting period compared to those that remain unchanged.|
|QC 19.|The completeness, clarity and comparability of sustainability disclosures all rely on information being presented as a coherent whole. For sustainability disclosures to be coherent, they shall be presented in a way that explains the context and the connections between the related information. Coherence also requires the undertaking to provide information in a way that allows users to relate information about its sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities to information in the undertaking’s financial statements.|
|QC 20.|If sustainability-related risks and opportunities discussed in the financial statements have implications for sustainability reporting, the undertaking shall include in the sustainability statement the information necessary for users to assess those implications and present appropriate links to the financial statements (see chapter 9 of this Standard). The level of information, granularity and technicality shall be aligned with the needs and expectations of users. Abbreviations shall be avoided and the units of measure shall be defined and disclosed.|

# Appendix E

Flowchart for determining disclosures under ESRS

Materiality assessment is the starting point for sustainability reporting under ESRS. This appendix provides a non-binding illustration of the impact- and financial materiality assessment outlined in chapter 3. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2 includes general disclosure requirements (DR) about the undertaking’s process to identify impacts, risks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2 provides general disclosures requirements on the material impact, risks and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s materiality assessment. The undertaking can omit all disclosure requirements in a topical standard if it assessed that the topic in question is not material. In that case it may disclose a brief explanation of the conclusions of the materiality assessment for that topic but shall disclose a detailed explanation in the case of ESRS E1 climate change (IRO-2 ESRS 2). ESRS set disclosure requirements, not behavioral requirements. Disclosure requirements in relation to action plans, targets, policies, scenario analysis and transition plans are proportionate because they are contingent on the undertaking having these, which may depend on the size, capacity, resources, and skills of the undertaking. Note: The flowchart below does not cover the situation in which the undertaking assesses a sustainability matter as material but it is not covered by a topical standard, in which case the undertaking shall make additional entity specific disclosures (ESRS 1 (30 (b)).

|Perform the impact and financial materiality assessment (informed by the table in AR 16 in Appendix A)|
|---|
|Is the topic covered by topical standard material?|No|
|For metrics|Has the undertaking established policies, taken actions or set targets for the topic?|No|
|The undertaking does not have to disclose the DRs or related Data Points (DP)|
|Is the individual Data Point (DP) material?|No|
|The undertaking does not have to disclose the Data Point (ESRSI para 34 (b))|
|Disclose the Data Points from the topical standard in conjunction with the relevant DRs of ESRS 2 (see ESRS 2 Appendix C):|
|The undertaking shall disclose the information required by the DP (ESRS1 para 34 (a))|

The undertaking can omit all disclosure requirements of the topical standard. But shall in case of ESRS EL Climate change, disclose detailed explanation of why climate change is not material and may disclose a brief explanation in the case of other topical standards (ESRS1 32) The undertaking shall disclose this to be the case and may report a timeframe in which it aims to have these in place (ESRSI 33)

# Strategy

# Disclosure Requirement SBM–1 Strategy, business model and value chain

AR 12. To provide the information on sectors required by paragraph 40, the undertaking shall map its significant activities in accordance with ESRS sectors. If a code for a sub-sector does not exist, the caption “others” shall be used.

AR 13. For the purposes of the disclosures required in paragraph 40, a group of products and/or services offered, a group of markets and/or customer groups served, or an ESRS sector, is significant for the undertaking if it meets one or both of the following criteria:
(a) it accounts for more than 10 per cent of the undertaking’s revenue;
(b) it is connected with material actual impacts or material potential negative impacts of the undertaking.

AR 14. In preparing disclosures relating to its business model and value chain, the undertaking shall consider:

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 59/284
---
# AR 18

This disclosure may be expressed in terms of a single impact, risk or opportunity or by aggregating groups of material impacts, risks and opportunities, when this provides more relevant information and does not obscure material information.

# Impact, risk and opportunity management

# Disclosure Requirement IRO-2 – Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement

# AR 19

Notwithstanding the basis for the presentation of the information about sustainability matters included in ESRS 1 chapter 8 Structure of sustainability statement, the undertaking may disclose the list of the Disclosure Requirements complied with in preparing the sustainability statement (see paragraph 54) in the general information part or in other parts of the sustainability statement as it deems appropriate. The undertaking may use a content index, i.e., a tabular list of the Disclosure Requirements included in the sustainability statement, with the indication of where they are located (page/paragraphs).

# Minimum Disclosure Requirement – Policies MDR-P – Policies adopted to manage material sustainability matters

# AR 20

Due to the interdependency between impacts on people and the environment, risks and opportunities, a single policy may apply to several material sustainability matters, including matters addressed by more than one topical ESRS. For example, if a single policy covers both an environmental matter and a social matter, the undertaking may report on the policy in the environmental section of its sustainability statement. In this case, it should include in the social section a cross-reference to the environmental section where the policy is reported. Equally a policy may be reported in the social section with a cross-reference to it in the environmental section.

# AR 21

The description of the scope of the policy may explain which activities and/or segments of the undertaking’s own operations or upstream and downstream value chain it concerns. The description may also explain further boundaries relevant to the specific topic or the undertaking’s circumstances, which may include geographies, life cycles, etc. In certain cases, such as if the policy does not cover the full value chain, the undertaking may provide clear information regarding the extent of the value chain covered by the policy.

# Minimum disclosure requirement – Actions MDR-A – Actions and resources in relation to material sustainability matters

# AR 22

Key actions in the context of this Minimum Disclosure Requirement are those actions that materially contribute to achieving the undertaking’s objectives in addressing material impacts, risks and opportunities. For reasons of understandability, key actions may be aggregated where appropriate.

# AR 23

Information on resource allocation may be presented in the form of a table and broken down between capital expenditure and operating expenditure, and across the relevant time horizons, and between resources applied in the current reporting year and the planned allocation of resources over specific time horizons.

# Metrics and targets

# Minimum Disclosure Requirement – Targets MDR-T – Tracking effectiveness of policies and actions through targets

# AR 24

When disclosing targets related to the prevention or mitigation of environmental impacts, the undertaking shall prioritise targets related to the reduction of the impacts in absolute terms rather than in relative terms. When targets address the prevention or mitigation of social impacts, they may be specified in terms of the effects on human rights, welfare or positive outcomes for affected stakeholders.
---
# AR 25

The information on progress made towards achieving the targets may be presented in a comprehensive table, including information on the baseline and target value, milestones, and achieved performance over the prior periods.

# AR 26

Where the undertaking describes progress in achieving the objectives of a policy in the absence of a measurable target, it may specify a baseline against which the progress is considered. For example, the undertaking may assess an increase of wages by a certain percentage for those below a fair wage; or may assess the quality of its relationships with local communities by reference to the proportion of issues raised by communities that were resolved to their satisfaction. The baseline and the assessment of the progress shall be related to the impacts, risks and opportunities which underpin the materiality of the matter addressed by the policy.

# Appendix A

# Application Requirements

This Appendix is an integral part of the ESRS E1. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.

# Strategy

Disclosure Requirement E1-1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation

|AR 1.|A transition plan relates to the undertaking’s efforts in climate change mitigation. When disclosing its transition plan, the undertaking is expected to provide a high-level explanation of how it will adjust its strategy and business model to ensure compatibility with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement (or an updated international agreement on climate change) and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 with no or limited overshoot as established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 (European Climate Law), and where applicable, how it will adjust its exposure to coal, and oil and gas-related activities.|
|---|---|
|AR 2.|Sectoral pathways have not yet been defined by the public policies for all sectors. Hence, the disclosure under paragraph 16 (a) on the compatibility of the transition plan with the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C should be understood as the disclosure of the undertaking’s GHG emissions reduction target. The disclosure under paragraph 16 (a) shall be benchmarked in relation to a pathway to 1.5°C. This benchmark should be based on either a sectoral decarbonisation pathway if available for the undertaking’s sector or an economy-wide scenario bearing in mind its limitations (i.e., it is a simple translation of emission reduction objectives from the state to undertaking level). This AR should be read also in conjunction with AR 26 and AR 27 and the sectoral decarbonisation pathways they refer to.|
|AR 3.|When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16(d) the undertaking may consider:|
| |(a) the cumulative locked-in GHG emissions associated with key assets from the reporting year until 2030 and 2050 in tCO2eq. This will be assessed as the sum of the estimated Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the operating lifetime of the active and firmly planned key assets. Key assets are those owned or controlled by the undertaking, and they consist of existing or planned assets (such as stationary or mobile installations, facilities, and equipment) that are sources of either significant direct or energy-indirect GHG emissions. Firmly planned key assets are those that the undertaking will most likely deploy within the next 5 years.|
| |(b) the cumulative locked-in GHG emissions associated with the direct use-phase GHG emissions of sold products in tCO2eq, assessed as the sales volume of products in the reporting year multiplied by the sum of estimated direct use-phase GHG emissions over their expected lifetime. This requirement only applies if the undertaking has identified the Scope 3 category “use of sold products” as significant under Disclosure Requirement E1-6 paragraph 51; and|
| |(c) an explanation of the plans to manage, i.e., to transform, decommission or phase out its GHG-intensive and energy-intensive assets and products.|
|AR 4.|When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16 (e), the undertaking shall explain how the alignment of its economic activities with the provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 is expected to evolve over time to support its transition to a sustainable economy. In doing so, the undertaking shall take account of the key performance indicators required to be disclosed under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (in particular taxonomy-aligned revenue and CapEx and, if applicable, CapEx plans).|

When disclosing the information on how the resilience analysis has been conducted as required under paragraph 19 (b), the undertaking shall explain:

- (a) the critical assumptions about how the transition to a lower-carbon and resilient economy will affect its surrounding macroeconomic trends, energy consumption and mix, and technology deployment assumptions;
- (b) the time horizons applied and their alignment with the climate and business scenarios considered for determining material physical and transition risks (paragraphs AR 11 to AR 12) and setting GHG emissions reduction targets (reported under Disclosure Requirement E1-4); and
- (c) how the estimated anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-9) as well as the mitigation actions and resources (disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1-3) were considered.

# AR 8

When disclosing the information on the results of the resilience analysis as required under paragraph 19 (c), the undertaking shall explain:

- (a) the areas of uncertainties of the resilience analysis and to what extent the assets and business activities at risk are considered within the definition of the undertaking’s strategy, investment decisions, and current and planned mitigation actions;
- (b) the ability of the undertaking to adjust or adapt its strategy and business model to climate change over the short-, medium- and long-term, including securing ongoing access to finance at an affordable cost of capital, the ability to redeploy, upgrade or decommission existing assets, shifting its products and services portfolio, or reskilling its workforce.

Article 12.1 of the Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation states that “Administrators of EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks shall exclude the following companies:

- a) companies that derive 1% or more of their revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or refining of hard coal and lignite; or

Climate-related scenario analysis

AR 13. When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 19, 20, 21, AR 10 and AR 11, the undertaking shall explain how it has used climate-related scenario analysis that is commensurate to its circumstances to inform the identification and assessment of physical and transition risks and opportunities over the short-, medium- and long-term, including:

- (a) which scenarios were used, their sources and alignment with state-of-the-art science;
- (b) narratives, time horizons, and endpoints used with a discussion of why it believes the range of scenarios used covers its plausible risks and uncertainties;
- (c) the key forces and drivers taken into consideration in each scenario and why these are relevant to the undertaking, for example, policy assumptions, macroeconomic trends, energy usage and mix, and technology assumptions; and
- (d) key inputs and constraints of the scenarios, including their level of detail (e.g., whether the analysis of physical climate-related risks is based on geospatial coordinates specific to the undertaking’s locations or national- or regional-level broad data).

AR 14. When conducting scenario analysis, the undertaking may consider the following guidance: TCFD Technical Supplement on “The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities” (2017); TCFD “Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies” (2020); ISO 14091:2021 “Adaptation to climate change — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment”; any other recognised industry standards such as NGFS (Network for Greening the Financial System); and EU, national, regional and local regulations.

AR 15. The undertaking shall briefly explain how the climate scenarios used are compatible with the critical climate-related assumptions made in the financial statements.

Disclosure Requirement E1-2 – Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation

AR 16. Policies related to either climate change mitigation or climate adaptation may be disclosed separately as their objectives, people involved, actions and resources needed to implement them are different.

AR 17. Policies related to climate change mitigation address the management of the undertaking’s GHG emissions, GHG removals and transition risks over different time horizons, in its own operations and/or in the upstream and downstream value chain. The requirement under paragraph 14 may relate to stand-alone climate change mitigation policies as well as relevant policies on other matters that indirectly support climate change mitigation including training policies, procurement or supply chain policies, investment policies or product development policies.

AR 18. Policies related to climate change adaptation address the management of the undertaking’s physical climate risks and of its transition risks related to climate change adaptation. The requirement under paragraphs 22 and 25 may relate to stand-alone climate change adaptation policies as well as relevant policies on other matters that indirectly support climate change adaptation including training policies, and emergency or health and safety policies.

# Disclosure Requirements E1-3 – Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies

AR 19. When disclosing the information on actions as required under paragraphs 29 (a) and 29 (b), the undertaking may:

- (a) disclose its key actions taken and/or plans to implement climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in its single or separate actions;
- (b) aggregate types of mitigation actions (decarbonisation levers) such as energy efficiency, electrification, fuel switching, use of renewable energy, products change, and supply-chain decarbonisation that fit the undertakings' specific actions;
- (c) disclose the list of key mitigation actions alongside the measurable targets (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-4) with disaggregation by decarbonisation levers; and
- (d) disclose the climate change adaptation actions by type of adaptation solution such as nature-based adaptation, engineering, or technological solutions.

AR 20. When disclosing the information on resources as required under paragraph 29 (c), the undertaking shall only disclose the significant OpEx and CapEx amounts required for the implementation of the actions as the purpose of this information is to demonstrate the credibility of its actions rather than to reconcile the disclosed amounts to the financial statements. The disclosed CapEx and OpEx amounts shall be the additions made to both tangible and intangible assets during the current financial year as well as the planned additions for future periods of implementing the actions. The disclosed amounts shall only be the incremental financial investments directly contributing to the achievement of the undertaking’s targets.

AR 21. In line with the requirements of ESRS 2 MDR-A, the undertaking shall explain if and to what extent its ability to implement the actions depends on the availability and allocation of resources. Ongoing access to finance at an affordable cost of capital can be critical for the implementation of the undertaking’s actions, which include its adjustments to supply/demand changes or its related acquisitions and significant research and development (R&D) investments.

AR 22. The amounts of OpEx and CapEx required for the implementation of the actions disclosed under paragraph 29 (c) shall be consistent with the key performance indicators (CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators) and, if applicable, the CapEx plan required by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. The undertaking shall explain any potential differences between the significant OpEx and CapEx amounts disclosed under this Standard and the key performance indicators disclosed under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 due to, for instance, the disclosure of non-eligible economic activities as defined in that delegated regulation. The undertaking may structure its actions by economic activity to compare its OpEx and CapEx, and if applicable its OpEx and/or CapEx plans to its Taxonomy-aligned key performance indicators.

# Metrics and targets

# Disclosure Requirement E1-4 – Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation

AR 23. Under paragraph 34 (a), the undertaking may disclose GHG emission reduction targets in intensity value. Intensity targets are formulated as ratios of GHG emissions relative to a unit of physical activity or economic output. Relevant units of activity or output are referred to in ESRS sector-specific standards. In cases where the undertaking has only set a GHG intensity reduction target, it shall nevertheless disclose the associated absolute values for the target year and interim target year(s). This may result in a situation where an undertaking is required to disclose an increase of absolute GHG emissions for the target year and interim target year(s), for example because it anticipates organic growth of its business.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 91/284
---
# AR 24

When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34 (b), the undertaking shall specify the share of the target related to each respective GHG emission Scope (1, 2 or 3). The undertaking shall state the method used to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions included in the target (i.e., either the location-based or market-based method). If the boundary of the GHG emission reduction target diverges from that of the GHG emissions reported under Disclosure Requirement E1-6, the undertaking shall disclose which gases are covered, the respective percentage of Scope 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions covered by the target. For the GHG emission reduction targets of its subsidiaries, the undertaking shall analogously apply these requirements at the level of the subsidiary.

# AR 25

When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34(c) on base year and baseline value:

- (a) the undertaking shall briefly explain how it has ensured that the baseline value against which the progress towards the target is measured is representative in terms of the activities covered and the influences from external factors (e.g., temperature anomalies in a certain year influencing the amount of energy consumption and related GHG emissions). This can be done by the normalization of the baseline value, or, by using a baseline value that is derived from a 3-year average if this increases the representativeness and allows a more faithful representation;
- (b) the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in either the target or reporting boundary occur. In such a case, the undertaking shall explain how the new baseline value affects the new target, its achievement and presentation of progress over time. To foster comparability, when setting new targets, the undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting year of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the target year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be selected from the period between 2022 and 2025;
- (c) the undertaking shall update its base year from 2030 and after every 5-year period thereafter. This means that before 2030, the base years chosen by undertakings’ may be either the currently applied base year for existing targets or the first year of application of the sustainability reporting requirements as set out in Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 (2024, 2025 or 2026) and, after 2030, every 5 years (2030, 2035, etc); and
- (d) when presenting climate-related targets, the undertaking may disclose the progress in meeting these targets made before its current base year. In doing so, the undertaking shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the information on past progress is consistent with the requirements of this Standard. In the case of methodological differences, for example, regarding target boundaries, the undertaking shall provide a brief explanation for these differences.

# AR 26

When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 34 (d) and 34 (e), the undertaking shall present the information over the target period with reference to a sector-specific, if available, or a cross-sector emission pathway compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. For this purpose, the undertaking shall calculate a 1.5°C aligned reference target value for Scope 1 and 2 (and, if applicable, a separate one for Scope 3) against which its own GHG emission reduction targets or interim targets in the respective Scopes can be compared.

# AR 27

The reference target value may be calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions in the base year with either a sector-specific (sectoral decarbonisation methodology) or cross-sector (contraction methodology) emission reduction factor. These emission reduction factors can be derived from different sources. The undertaking should ensure that the source used is based on an emission reduction pathway compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

# AR 28

The emission reduction factors are subject to further development. Consequently, undertakings are encouraged to only use updated publicly available information.

Cross-sector (ACA) reductions pathway based on the year 2020 as the reference year

| |2030|2050|
|---|---|---|
|Source:|- 42%|- 90%|

AR 29. The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the undertaking’s GHG emission reduction target. As a result, the reference target value for undertakings with a recent base year or from higher baseline emissions may be less challenging to achieve than it will be for undertakings that have already taken ambitious past actions to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings that have in the past achieved GHG emissions reductions compatible with either a 1.5°C-aligned cross-sector or sector-specific pathway, may adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference target value. Accordingly, if the undertaking is adjusting the baseline emissions to determine the reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission reductions that precede the year 2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG emission reduction.

AR 30. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34 (f), the undertaking shall explain:

- (a) by reference to its climate change mitigation actions, the decarbonisation levers and their estimated quantitative contributions to the achievement of its GHG emission reduction targets broken down by each Scope (1, 2 and 3);
- (b) whether it plans to adopt new technologies and the role of these to achieve its GHG emission reduction targets;
- (c) whether and how it has considered a diverse range of climate scenarios, at least including a climate scenario compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, to detect relevant environmental-, societal-, technology-, market- and policy-related developments and determine its decarbonisation levers.

AR 31. The undertaking may present its GHG emission reduction targets together with its climate change mitigation actions (see paragraph AR 19) as a table or graphical pathway showing developments over time. The following figure and table provide examples combining targets and decarbonisation levers:

|Activity|Reduction planned|

# Disclosure Requirement E1-5 – Energy consumption and mix

# Calculation guidance

AR 32.     When preparing the information on energy consumption required under paragraph 35, the undertaking shall:

- (a)  only report energy consumed from processes owned or controlled by the undertaking applying the same perimeter applied for reporting GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions;
- (b)  exclude feedstocks and fuels that are not combusted for energy purposes. The undertaking that consumes fuel as feedstocks can disclose information on this consumption separately from the required disclosures;
- (c)  ensure all quantitative energy-related information is reported in either Mega-Watt- hours (MWh) in Lower Heating Value or net calorific value. If raw data of energy- related information is only available in energy units other than MWh (such as Giga-Joules (GJ) or British Thermal Units (Btu)), in volume units (such as cubic feet or gallons) or in mass units (such as kilograms or pounds), they shall be converted to MWh using suitable conversion factors (see for example Annex II of the Fifth Assessment IPCC report). Conversion factors for fuels shall be made transparent and applied in a consistent manner;
- (d)  ensure all quantitative energy-related information is reported as final energy consumption, referring to the amount of energy the undertaking actually consumes using for example the table in Annex IV of Directive 2012/27 of the European Parliament and of the Council (48) on energy efficiency;
- (e)  avoid double counting fuel consumption when disclosing self-generated energy consumption. If the undertaking generates electricity from either a non-renewable or renewable fuel source and then consumes the generated electricity, the energy consumption shall be counted only once under fuel consumption;
- (f)  not offset energy consumption even if onsite generated energy is sold to and used by a third party;
- (g)  not count energy that is sourced from within the organisational boundary under “purchased or acquired” energy;

# Accounting for Energy Consumption and Mix

(h) account for steam, heat or cooling received as “waste energy” from a third party’s industrial processes under “purchased or acquired” energy;

(i) account for renewable hydrogen as a renewable fuel. Hydrogen that is not completely derived from renewable sources shall be included under “fuel consumption from other non-renewable sources”; and

(j) adopt a conservative approach when splitting the electricity, steam, heat or cooling between renewable and non-renewable sources based on the approach applied to calculate market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions. The undertaking shall only consider these energy consumptions as deriving from renewable sources if the origin of the purchased energy is clearly defined in the contractual arrangements with its suppliers (renewable power purchasing agreement, standardized green electricity tariff, market instruments like Guarantee of Origin from renewable sources in Europe or similar instruments like Renewable Energy Certificates in the US and Canada, etc.).

# Information Requirements for High Climate Impact Sectors

AR 33. The information required under paragraph 37 (a) is applicable if the undertaking is operating in at least one high climate impact sector.

- (a) calculate the energy intensity ratio using the following formula: Total energy consumption from activities in high climate impact sectors (MWh) Net revenue from activities in high climate impact sectors (Monetary unit)
- (b) express the total energy consumption in MWh and the net revenue in monetary units (e.g., Euros);
- (c) the numerator and denominator shall only consist of the proportion of the total final energy consumption (in the numerator) and net revenue (in the denominator) that are attributable to activities in high climate impact sectors. In effect, there should be consistency in the scope of both the numerator and denominator;
- (d) calculate the total energy consumption in line with the requirement in paragraph 37;

Disclosure Requirements E1-6 – Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions

Calculation guidance

AR 39. When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44, the undertaking shall:

- (a) consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004). The undertaking may consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 (51) or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064-1:2018. If the undertaking already applies the GHG accounting methodology of ISO 14064- 1: 2018, it shall nevertheless comply with the requirements of this standard (e.g., regarding reporting boundaries and the disclosure of market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions);
- (b) disclose the methodologies, significant assumptions and emissions factors used to calculate or measure GHG emissions accompanied by the reasons why they were chosen, and provide a reference or link to any calculation tools used;
- (c) include emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3. Additional GHG may be considered when significant; and
- (d) use the most recent Global Warming Potential (GWP) values published by the IPCC based on a 100-year time horizon to calculate CO2eq emissions of non-CO2 gases.

AR 40. When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions from its associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual arrangements as required by paragraph 50, the undertaking shall consolidate 100% of the GHG emissions of the entities it operationally controls. In practice, this happens when the undertakings holds the license - or permit - to operate the assets from these associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual arrangements. When the undertaking has a contractually defined part-time operational control, it shall consolidate 100% the GHG emitted during the time of its operational control.

# AR 41

In line with ESRS 1 chapter 3.7, the undertaking shall disaggregate information on its GHG emissions as appropriate. For example, the undertaking may disaggregate its Scope 1, 2, 3, or total GHG emissions by country, operating segments, economic activity, subsidiary, GHG category (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and other GHG considered by the undertaking) or source type (stationary combustion, mobile combustion, process emissions and fugitive emissions).

# AR 42

An undertaking might have a different reporting period from some or all of the entities in its value chain. In such circumstances, the undertaking is permitted to measure its GHG emissions in accordance with paragraph 44 using information for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting period if that information is obtained from entities in its value chain with reporting periods that are different from the undertaking’s reporting period, on the condition that:

- (a) the undertaking uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain to measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;
- (b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and
- (c) the undertaking discloses the effects of significant events and changes in circumstances (relevant to its GHG emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in its value chain and the date of the undertaking’s general purpose financial statements.

# AR 43

When preparing the information on gross Scope 1 GHG emissions required under paragraph 48 (a), the undertaking shall:

- (a) calculate or measure GHG emissions from stationary combustion, mobile combustion, process emissions and fugitive emissions; and use suitable activity data that include the non-renewable fuel consumption;
- (b) use suitable and consistent emission factors;
- (c) disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 from the combustion or bio-degradation of biomass separately from the Scope 1 GHG emissions, but include emissions of other types of GHG (in particular CH4 and N2O);
- (d) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances in the calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions; and
- (e) for activities reporting under the EU ETS, report on Scope 1 emissions following the EU ETS methodology. The EU ETS methodology may also be applied to activities in geographies and sectors that are not covered by the EU ETS.

# AR 44

When preparing the information on the percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated emission trading schemes required under paragraph 48 (b), the undertaking shall:

- (a) consider GHG emissions from the installations it operates that are subject to regulated Emission Trading Schemes (ETS), including the EU-ETS, national ETS and non-EU ETS, if applicable;
- (b) only include emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3;
- (c) ensure the same accounting period for gross Scope 1 GHG emissions and GHG emissions regulated under the ETS; and
- (d) calculate the share by using the following formula:

GHG Emissions in (t CO2eq) from EU ETS installations + national ETS installations + nonEU ETS installations
Scope 1 GHG emissions (t CO2eq)

# AR 45

When preparing the information on gross Scope 2 GHG emissions required under paragraph 49, the undertaking shall:

- (a) consider the principles and requirements of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (version 2015, in particular the Scope 2 quality criteria in chapter 7.1 relating to contractual instruments); it may also consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the relevant requirements for the quantification of indirect GHG emissions from imported energy in EN ISO 14064-1:2018;
---
(b) include purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the undertaking;

(c) avoid double counting of GHG emissions reported under Scope 1 or 3;

(d) apply the location-based and market-based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions and provide information on the share and types of contractual instruments. Location-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on average energy generation emission factors for defined locations, including local, subnational, or national boundaries (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015). Market-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on GHG emissions emitted by the generators from which the reporting entity contractually purchases electricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments on their own (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015); in this case, the undertaking may disclose the share of market-based scope 2 GHG emissions linked to purchased electricity bundled with instruments such as Guarantee of Origins or Renewable Energy Certificates. The undertaking shall provide information about the share and types of contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims.

(e) disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass separately from the Scope 2 GHG emissions but include emissions of other types of GHG (in particular CH4 and N2O). In case the emission factors applied do not separate the percentage of biomass or biogenic CO2, the undertaking shall disclose this. In case GHG emissions other than CO2 (particularly CH4 and N2O) are not available for, or excluded from, location-based grid average emissions factors or with the market-based method information, the undertaking shall disclose this.

(f) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances in the calculation of Scope 2 GHG emissions.

AR 46. When preparing the information on gross Scope 3 GHG emissions required under paragraph 51, the undertaking shall:

(a) consider the principles and provisions of the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011); and it may consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the relevant requirements for the quantification of indirect GHG emissions from EN ISO 14064-1:2018;

(b) if it is a financial institution, consider the GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial (PCAF), specifically part A “Financed Emissions” (version December 2022);

(c) screen its total Scope 3 GHG emissions based on the 15 Scope 3 categories identified by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011) using appropriate estimates. Alternatively, it may screen its indirect GHG emissions based on the categories provided by EN ISO 14064-1:2018 clause 5.2.4 (excluding indirect GHG emissions from imported energy);

(d) identify and disclose its significant Scope 3 categories based on the magnitude of their estimated GHG emissions and other criteria provided by GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011, p. 61 and 65-68) or EN ISO 14064-1:2018 Annex H.3.2, such as financial spend, influence, related transition risks and opportunities or stakeholder views;

(e) calculate or estimate GHG emissions in significant Scope 3 categories using suitable emissions factors;

(f) update Scope 3 GHG emissions in each significant category every year on the basis of current activity data; update the full Scope 3 GHG inventory at least every 3 years or on the occurrence of a significant event or a significant change in circumstances (a significant event or significant change in circumstances can, for example, relate to changes in the undertaking’s activities or structure, changes in the activities or structure of its upstream and downstream value chain(s), a change in calculation methodology or in the discovery of errors);”);
---
# EN

(g) disclose the extent to which the undertaking’s Scope 3 GHG emissions are measured using inputs from specific activities within the entity’s upstream and downstream value chain, and disclose the percentage of emissions calculated using primary data obtained from suppliers or other value chain partners.

(h) for each significant Scope 3 GHG category, disclose the reporting boundaries considered, the calculation methods for estimating the GHG emissions as well as if and which calculation tools were applied. The Scope 3 categories should be consistent with the GHGP and include:

- indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from the consolidated accounting group (the parent and its subsidiaries),
- indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, and unconsolidated subsidiaries for which the undertaking has the ability to control the operational activities and relationships (i.e., operational control),

# Disclosure Requirement E1-9 – Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks and potential climate-related opportunities

Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks

AR 67. Material climate-related physical risks and transition risks may affect the undertaking’s financial position (e.g., owned assets, financially-controlled leased assets, and liabilities), performance (e.g., potential future increase/decrease in net revenue and costs due to business interruptions, increased supply prices resulting in potential margin erosions), and cash flows. The low probability, high severity and long-term time horizons of some climate- related physical risk exposures and the uncertainty arising from the transition to a sustainable economy mean that there will be associated material anticipated financial effects that are outside the scope of the requirements of applicable accounting standards.
---
# AR 68

Currently, there is no commonly accepted methodology to assess or measure how material physical risks and transition risks may affect the undertaking’s future financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Therefore, the disclosure of the financial effects (as required by paragraphs 64, 66, and 67) will depend on the undertaking’s internal methodology and the exercise of significant judgment in determining the inputs and assumptions needed to quantify their anticipated financial effects.

# Calculation guidance - Anticipated financial effects from material physical risks

# AR 69

When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 64 (a) and 66, the undertaking shall explain whether and how:

- (a) it assessed the anticipated financial effects for assets and business activities at material physical risk, including the scope of application, time horizons, calculation methodology, critical assumptions and parameters, and limitations of the assessment; and
- (b) the assessment of assets and business activities considered to be at material physical risk relies on or is part of the process to determine material physical risk as required under paragraphs 20 (b) and AR 11 and to determine climate scenarios as required under paragraphs 19 and AR 13 to AR 14. In particular, it shall explain how it has defined medium- and long-term time horizons and how these definitions are linked to the expected lifetime of the undertaking’s assets, strategic planning horizons, and capital allocation plans.

# AR 70

When preparing the information on assets at material physical risk that is required to be disclosed under paragraph 66 (a), the undertaking shall:

- (a) Calculate the assets at material physical risk in terms of a monetary amount and as a proportion (percentage) of total assets at the reporting date (i.e., the proportion is an estimate of the carrying value of assets at material physical risk divided by total carrying value as stated in the statement of financial position or balance sheet). The estimate of assets at material physical risk shall be derived starting from the assets recognized in the financial statements. The estimate of monetary amounts and proportion of assets at physical risk may be presented as either a single amount or range.
- (b) All types of assets including finance-lease/right-of-use assets shall be considered when determining the assets at material physical risk.
- (c) To contextualize this information, the undertaking shall:
- i. disclose the location of its significant assets at material physical risk. Significant assets located in the EU territory shall be aggregated by NUTS codes 3 level digits (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). For significant assets located outside EU territory, the breakdown by NUTS code will only be provided where applicable.
- ii. disaggregate the monetary amounts of assets at risk by acute and chronic physical risk.
- (d) calculate the share of assets at material physical risk resulting from paragraph 66 (a) that is addressed by the climate change adaptation actions based on the information disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1-3. This aims at approximating net risks.

# AR 71

When preparing the information required under paragraph 64 (a) and 66 (d), the undertaking may assess and disclose the share of net revenue from business activities at physical risk. This disclosure

- (a) shall be based on the net revenue in line with the requirements in accounting standards applied for financial statements, i.e., IFRS 15 or local GAAP.

|AR 72.|When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 64 (b) and 67 (a), the undertaking shall explain whether and how:|
|---|---|
| |(a) it has assessed the potential effects on future financial performance and position for assets and business activities at material transition risk, including the scope of application, calculation methodology, critical assumptions and parameters, and limitations of the assessment; and|
| |(b) the assessment of assets and business activities considered to be at material transition risk relies on or is part of the process to determine material transition risks as described under paragraphs 20 (c) and AR 11 and to determine scenarios as required under paragraphs AR 12 to AR 13. In particular, it shall explain how it has defined medium- and long-term time horizons and how these definitions are linked to the expected lifetime of the undertaking’s assets, strategic planning horizons and capital allocation plans.|

# AR 73.

When disclosing the information on assets at material transition risk as required under paragraphs 67 (a) and (b):

- (a) the undertaking shall at the very least include an estimate of the amount of potentially stranded assets (in monetary amounts and as a proportion/percentage) from the reporting year until 2030 and from 2030 to 2050. Stranded assets are understood as the active or firmly planned key assets of the undertaking with significant locked-in GHG emissions over their operating lifetime. Firmly planned key assets are those that the undertaking will most likely deploy within the next 5 years. The amount may be expressed as a range of asset values based on different climate and policy scenarios, including a scenario aligned with limiting climate change to 1.5°C.
- (b) the undertaking shall disclose a breakdown of the carrying value of its real estate assets, including rights-of-use assets, by energy efficiency classes. The energy efficiency shall be represented in terms of either the ranges of energy consumption in kWh/m2 or the EPC (54) (Energy Performance Certificate) (55) label class. If the undertaking cannot obtain this information on a best-effort basis, it shall disclose the total carrying amount of the real estate assets for which the energy consumption is based on internal estimates.
- (c) the undertaking shall calculate the proportion (percentage) of total assets (including finance lease/right-of-use assets) at material transition risk addressed by the climate change mitigation actions based on the information disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1-3. The total assets amount is the carrying amount on the balance sheet at the reporting date.

# AR 74.

When disclosing the information on potential liabilities from material transition risks required under paragraph 67(d):

- (a) undertakings that operate installations regulated under an emission trading scheme may include a range of potential future liabilities originating from these schemes;
- (b) undertakings subject to the EU ETS, may disclose the potential future liabilities that relate to their allocation plans for the period before and until 2030. The potential liability may be estimated on the basis of:

(54) Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (OJ L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13).

(55) This disclosure requirement is consistent with the requirements of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template 2 immovable property, energy efficiency of the collateral.

Other approaches and methodologies may be applied to assess how transition risks may affect the future financial position of the undertaking. In any case, the disclosure of anticipated financial effects shall include a description of the methodologies and definitions used by the undertaking.

# AR 76

When preparing the information required under paragraph 67 (e), the undertaking may assess and disclose the share of net revenue from business activities at transition risks. This disclosure:

- shall be based on the net revenue in line with the requirements in accounting standards applied for financial statements, i.e., IFRS 15 or local GAAP.
- may include a breakdown of the undertaking’s business activities with the corresponding details of the associated percentage of current net revenue, risk factors (events and exposure), and when possible, the anticipated financial effects related to margin erosion over the short-, medium- and long-term. The nature of business activities may also be disaggregated by operating segments if the undertaking has disclosed the contribution of margins by operational segments in its segment reporting in the financial statements.

(56) The cost rate is the factor used to convert non-monetary impacts like tonnes, hectares, m3 etc. into monetary units. Cost rates should be based on monetary valuation studies, need to be science-based and the methods used to obtain them transparent. Guidance on these methods can be obtained, e.g., from the EU-LIFE-funded TRANSPARENT project.

Adjusting items
Assets or liabilities or net revenue in the financial statements

AR 78. The undertaking shall ensure the consistency of data and assumptions to assess and report the anticipated financial effects from material physical risks and transition risks in the sustainability statement with the corresponding data and assumptions used for the financial statements (e.g., carbon prices used for assessing impairment of assets, the useful life of assets, estimates and provisions). The undertaking shall explain the reasons for any inconsistencies (e.g., if the full financial implications of climate-related risks are still under assessment or are not deemed material in the financial statements).

AR 79. For potential future effects on liabilities (as required by paragraph 67 (d)), if applicable, the undertaking shall cross-reference the description of the emission trading schemes in the financial statements.

OJ L, 22.12.2023

(e) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s pollution-related impacts and dependencies.

This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability matters: pollution of air, water, soil, substances of concern, including substances of very high concern.

“Pollution of air” refers to the undertaking’s emissions into air (both indoor and outdoor), and prevention, control and reduction of such emissions.

“Pollution of water” refers to the undertaking’s emissions to water, and prevention, control and reduction of such emissions.

“Pollution of soil” refers to the undertaking’s emissions into soil and the prevention, control and reduction of such emissions.

With regard to “substances of concern”, this standard covers the undertaking’s production, use and/or distribution and commercialization of substances of concern, including substances of very high concern. Disclosure Requirements on substances of concern aim at providing users with an understanding of actual or potential impacts related to such substances, also taking account of possible restrictions on their use and/or distribution and commercialization.

Interaction with other ESRS

The topic of pollution is closely connected to other environmental sub-topics such as climate change, water and marine resources, biodiversity and circular economy. Thus, to provide a comprehensive overview of what could be material to pollution, relevant Disclosure Requirements are covered in other environmental Standards as follows:

|ESRS E1 Climate change|ESRS E3 Water and marine resources|ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems|ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy|

|carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)|water consumption, in particular in areas at water risk, water recycling and storage. This also includes the responsible management of marine resources, including the nature and quantity of marine resources-related commodities (such as gravels, deep-sea minerals, seafood) used by the undertaking. This Standard covers the negative impacts, in terms of pollution of water and marine resources, including microplastics, generated by such activities.|ecosystems and species. Pollution as a direct impact driver of biodiversity loss is addressed by this Standard.|the transition away from extraction of non-renewable resources and the implementation of practices that prevent waste generation, including pollution generated by waste.|

The undertaking’s pollution-related impacts may affect people and communities. Material negative impacts on affected communities from pollution-related impacts attributable to the undertaking are covered in ESRS S3 Affected communities.

This Standard should be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures.

# ESRS 2 GENERAL DISCLOSURES

Impact, risk and opportunity management

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material water and marine resources-related impacts, risks and opportunities

|AR 1.|When conducting a materiality assessment on environmental subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the materiality of water and marine resources in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, and may consider the four phases below, also known as the LEAP approach:|
|---|---|
| |(a) Phase 1: locate where in its own operations and along the value chain the interface with nature takes place;|
| |(b) Phase 2: evaluate the dependencies and impacts;|
| |(c) Phase 3: assess the material risks and opportunities; and|
| |(d) Phase 4: prepare and report the results of the materiality assessment.|

AR 2. The materiality assessment for ESRS E3 corresponds to the first three phases of this LEAP approach, the fourth phase addresses the outcome of the process.

AR 3. The processes to assess the materiality of impacts, risks and opportunities shall consider the provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities, and IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement.

AR 4. The sub-topics related to water and marine resources covered by the materiality assessment include:

- (a) water, which encompasses the consumption of surface water, groundwater, as well as withdrawals and discharges of water; and
- (b) marine resources, which encompasses the extraction and use of such resources and associated economic activities.

AR 5. In phase 1, to locate where there are areas at water risk, and areas where there is an interface with marine resources that could lead to material impacts and dependencies in its own operations and along its upstream and downstream value chain, the undertaking may consider:

- (a) the locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream activities across the value chain;
- (b) the sites located in areas at water risk, including areas of high-water stress; and
- (c) the sectors or business units that are interfacing with water or marine resources in these priority locations.

AR 6. The undertaking shall consider river basins as the relevant level for assessment of locations and combine that approach with an operational risk assessment of its facilities and the facilities of suppliers with material impacts and risks.

AR 7. The undertaking shall consider the criteria for defining the status of water bodies according to the relevant Annexes of Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive) as well as the guidance documents provided for implementation of the Water Framework Directive. The list of guidance documents can be accessed under the European Commission’s Environment home page.
---
# AR 8.

In phase 2, to evaluate its impacts and dependencies for each priority location identified under AR 5, the undertaking may:

- (a) identify business processes and activities that lead to impacts and dependencies on environmental assets and ecosystem services;
- (b) identify water and marine resources-related impacts and dependencies across the undertaking’s value chain; and
- (c) assess the severity and likelihood of the positive and negative impacts on water and marine resources.

# AR 9.

For the identification of water and marine resources-related dependencies, the undertaking may rely on international classifications such as the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES).

# AR 10.

When identifying its marine resources-related dependencies, the undertaking shall consider if it depends upon key marine resources-related commodities, including but not limited to gravels and seafood products.

# AR 11.

Marine resources are defined according to their use by human societies and must be considered in relation to the pressure they are subject to. Some of the pressure indicators are presented in other ESRS, namely microplastics and emissions to water in ESRS E2 and plastic waste in ESRS E5.

# AR 12.

Examples of marine resources dependencies which may be considered by the undertaking are:

- (a) dependencies on commercially exploited fish and shellfish in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain; and
- (b) fishing activity that involves mobile bottom trawling, which can also have negative impacts on the seabed.

# AR 13.

In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking may:

- (a) identify transition risks and opportunities in its own operations and its value chain by the categories of:
- - i. policy and legal: e.g., introduction of regulation or policy (e.g., changes such as increased water protection, increased quality of water regulations, regulation of flows of water supply), ineffective governance of water bodies or marine resources, in particular across boundaries (e.g., transboundary governance and cooperation) resulting in water or oceans degradation, exposure to sanctions and litigation (e.g., non-respect of permits or allocations; negligence towards or killing of threatened marine species), enhanced reporting obligations on marine ecosystems and related services;
- ii. technology: e.g., substitution of products or services by products or services with a lower impact on water and marine resources, transition to more efficient and cleaner technologies (i.e., with lower impacts on oceans and water), new monitoring technologies (e.g., satellite), water purification, flood protection;
- iii. market: e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing, volatility or increased costs of water or marine resources;
- iv. reputation: e.g., changing societal, customer or community perceptions as a result of an organisation’s impact on water and marine resources; and
- v. contribution to systemic risks via its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including the risks that a marine ecosystem collapses or the risks that a critical natural system no longer functions (e.g., tipping points are reached, summing physical risks);

(b) identify physical risk including water quantity (water scarcity, water stress), water quality, infrastructure decay or unavailability of some marine resources-related commodities (e.g. the rarefaction of some species of fish or other underwater marine living organisms sold as products by the undertaking) leading for instance to the impossibility of running operations in certain geographical areas;

# EN

OJ L, 22.12.2023

(c) identify opportunities categorised by:

- i. resource efficiency: e.g., transition to more efficient services and processes requiring less water and marine resources;
- ii. markets: e.g., development of less resource-intense products and services, diversification of business activities;
- iii. financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;
- iv. resilience: e.g., diversification of marine or water resources and business activities (e.g., starting a new business unit on ecosystem restoration), investing in green infrastructures, nature-based solutions, adopting recycling and circularity mechanisms that reduce the dependencies on water or marine resources; and
- v. reputation: positive stakeholder engagement as a result of a proactive stance on managing nature-related risks (e.g., leading to preferred partner status).

AR 14. The undertaking may rely on primary, secondary or modelled data collection or other relevant approaches to assess material impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, including Commission Recommendation 2021/2279 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (Annex I – Product Environmental Footprint; Annex III – Organisation Environmental Footprint).

AR 15. When providing information on the outcome of the materiality assessment, the undertaking shall consider:

- (a) a list of geographical areas where water is a material issue for the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain;
- (b) a list of marine resources-related commodities used by the undertaking which are material to the good environmental status of marine waters as well as for the protection of marine resources; and
- (c) a list of sectors or segments associated with water and marine resources material impacts, risks and opportunities.

Disclosure Requirement E3-1 – Policies related to water and marine resources

AR 16. The policies described under this Disclosure Requirement may be integrated in broader environmental or sustainability policies covering different subtopics.

AR 17. When disclosing information under paragraph 9, the undertaking may disclose whether its policies :

- (a) prevent further deterioration and protect and enhance the status of water bodies and aquatic ecosystems;
- (b) promote sustainable water use based on a long-term protection of available water resources;
- (c) aim at enhanced protection and improvement of the aquatic environment;
- (d) promote a good environmental status of marine water; and
- (e) promote reduction of water withdrawals and water discharges.

AR 18. The undertaking may also disclose information about policies which:

- (a) contribute to good ecological and chemical quality of surface water bodies and good chemical quality and quantity of groundwater bodies, in order to protect human health, water supply, natural ecosystems and biodiversity, the good environmental status of marine waters and the protection of the resource base upon which marine related activities depend;
- (b) minimise material impacts and risks and implement mitigation measures that aim to maintain the value and functionality of priority services and to increase resource efficiency on own operations; and
- (c) avoid impacts on affected communities.

# AR 6

The undertaking shall assess the materiality of biodiversity and ecosystems in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, and may conduct its materiality assessment in line with the first three phases of the LEAP approach: Locate (paragraph AR 7), Evaluate (paragraph AR 8) and Assess (paragraph AR 9).

# AR 7

Phase 1 relates to the localisation of relevant sites regarding its interface with biodiversity and ecosystems. To identify these relevant sites the undertaking may:

(a) develop a list of locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream value chain pat are relevant to pe undertakings business activities. Furpermore, pe undertaking may provide information about sites for which future operations have been formally announced;

(e) identify which sectors, business units, value chains or asset classes are interfacing wip biodiversity and ecosystems in pese material sites. Instead of identifying pese interfaces per site, pe undertaking may choose to identify pem per raw material procured or sold by weight in tons, if such practice offers greater transparency.

# AR 8

In Phase 2, to evaluate its actual or potential impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems for relevant sites, the undertaking may:

(a) identify business processes and activities pat interface wip biodiversity and ecosystems;
(b) identify actual and potential impacts and dependencies;
(c) indicate pe size, scale, frequency of occurrence and timeframe of pe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems taking into consideration pe disclosures under paragraphs 16 and 17. Furpermore, pe undertaking may disclose:
i. pe percentage of its suppliers’ facilities which are located in risk prone areas (wip preatened species on pe IUCN Red List of Species, pe Birds and Habitats Directive or nationally list of preatened species, or in officially recognised Protected Areas, pe Natura 2000 network of protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas);
ii. pe percentage of its procurement spend from suppliers wip facilities which are located in risk prone areas (wip preatened species on pe IUCN Red List of Species, pe Birds and Habitats Directive or nationally list of preatened species, or in officially recognised Protected Areas, pe Natura 2000 network of protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas); and
(d) indicate pe size and scale of pe dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems, including on raw materials, natural resources and ecosystem services. The undertaking may rely on pe international classifications such as pe Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES).

# AR 9

In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking may consider the following categories:

(a) physical risks:

- i. acute risks (e.g., natural disasters exacerbated by loss of coastal protection from ecosystems, leading to costs of storm damage to coastal infrastructure, disease or pests affecting the species or variety of crop the undertaking relies on, especially in the case of no or low genetic diversity, species loss and ecosystem degradation); and
---
# ii. chronic risks

(e.g., loss of crop yield due to decline in pollination services, increasing scarcity or variable production of key natural inputs, ecosystem degradation due to operations leading to, for example, coastal erosion and forest fragmentation, ocean acidification, land loss to desertification and soil degradation and consequent loss of soil fertility, species loss).

# (b) transition risks, including:

i. policy and legal: e.g. introduction of regulation or policy (e.g. changes such as increased land protection); exposure to sanctions and litigation (e.g. spills of polluting effluents that damage human and ecosystem health; or violation of biodiversity-related rights, permits or allocations; or negligence towards or killing of threatened species); enhanced reporting obligations on biodiversity, ecosystems and related services;

ii. technology: e.g. substitution of products or services by products or services with a lower impact on biodiversity or dependence on ecosystem services, lack of access to data or access to poor quality data that hamper biodiversity-related assessments, transition to more efficient and cleaner technologies (i.e. with lower impacts on biodiversity), new monitoring technologies (e.g. satellite), requirements to use certain technologies (e.g. climate resistant crops, mechanical pollinators, water purification, flood protection);

iii. market: e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing, volatility or increased costs of raw materials (e.g., biodiversity-intense inputs for which price has risen due to ecosystem degradation);

iv. reputation: e.g., changing societal, customer or community perceptions as a result of an organisation’s role in loss of biodiversity, violation of nature-related rights through operations, negative media coverage due to impacts on critical species and/or ecosystems, biodiversity-related social conflicts over endangered species, protected areas, resources or pollution.

# (c) systemic risks, including:

i. ecosystem collapse risks that a critical natural system no longer functions, e.g., tipping points are reached and the collapse of ecosystems resulting in wholesale geographic or sector losses (summing physical risks);

ii. aggregated risk linked to fundamental impacts of biodiversity loss to levels of transition and physical risk across one or more sectors in a portfolio (corporate or financial); and

iii. contagion risks that financial difficulties of certain corporations or financial institutions linked to failure to account for exposure to biodiversity-related risks spill over to the economic system as a whole.

# (d) opportunities, including for example:

i. business performance categories: resource efficiency; products and services; markets; capital flow and financing; reputational capital;

ii. sustainability performance categories: ecosystem protection, restoration and regeneration; sustainability use of natural resources.

# Disclosure Requirement E4-3 – Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems

AR 18. The undertaking may relate significant monetary amounts of CapEx and OpEx required to implement the actions taken or planned to:

1. the relevant line items or notes in the financial statements;
2. the key performance indicators required under article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178; and
3. if applicable, the CapEx plan required by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.

AR 19. The undertaking may disclose whether it considers an “avoidance” action plan, which prevents damaging actions before they take place. Avoidance often involves a decision to deviate from the business-as-usual project development path. An example of avoidance is altering the biodiversity and ecosystem footprint of a project to avoid destruction of natural habitat on the site and/or establishing set-asides where priority biodiversity values are present and will be conserved. At a minimum, avoidance should be considered where there are biodiversity and ecosystem-related values that are in one of the following categories: particularly vulnerable and irreplaceable, of particular concern to stakeholders, or where a cautious approach is warranted due to uncertainty about impact assessment or about the efficacy of management measures. The three main types of avoidance are defined below:

1. Avoidance through site selection (Locate the entire project away from areas recognized for important biodiversity values);
2. Avoidance through project design (Configure infrastructure to preserve areas at the project site with important biodiversity values); and
3. Avoidance through scheduling (Time project activities to account for patterns of species behavior (e.g., breeding, migration) or ecosystem functions (e.g., river dynamics).

judgment can be used where data gaps exist. The methodology shall be sufficiently detailed to allow for meaningful comparison of impacts and mitigation activities over time. Information gathering processes and definitions must be systematically applied. This enables a meaningful review of the undertaking’s performance over time and helps internal and peer comparison.

# AR 29.

If a metric corresponds to a target, the baseline for both shall be aligned. The biodiversity baseline is an essential component of the larger biodiversity and ecosystems management process. The baseline is necessary to inform impact assessment and management planning, as well as monitoring and adaptive management.

# AR 30.

Methodologies available to collect data and measure the undertakings’ impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems may be separated into three categories as follows:

(a) primary data: collected in-situ using on pe ground surveys;
(b) secondary data: including geospatial data layers pat are overlaid wip geographic location data of business activities.
i. At pe species level, data layers on pe ranges of different species can be used to predict pe species pat may be present at different locations. This includes operation sites and sourcing locations. Different range layers will have different levels of accuracy depending on certain factors (e.g., wheper species ranges have been refined based on availability of habitat). Information on pe preat status of pe species, and pe activities pat preaten pem, can provide an indication of pe likely contribution pat business activities may be having on driving population trends and preat status.
ii. At pe ecosystem level, data layers reflecting change in pe extent and condition of ecosystems can be applied, including levels of habitat fragmentation and connectivity.
(c) modelled biodiversity state data: Model-based approaches are commonly used for measuring ecosystem level indicators (e.g., extent, condition, or function). Models quantify how pe magnitude of different pressures affects pe state of biodiversity. These are referred to as pressure-state relationships and are based on globally collected data. Modelling results are applied locally to estimate how undertaking-level pressures will cause changes in ecosystem condition. An impact driver generally has pree main characteristics: magnitude (e.g., amount of contaminant, noise intensity), spatial extent (e.g., area of land contaminated) and temporal extent (duration of persistence of contaminant).

# Objective

The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand:

1. how the undertaking affects resource use, including resource efficiency, avoiding the depletion of resources and the sustainable sourcing and use of renewable resources (referred to in this Standard as “resource use and circular economy”) in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
2. any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent or mitigate actual or potential negative impacts arising from resource use, including its measures to help decoupling its economic growth from the use of materials, and to address risks and opportunities;
---
(c) the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model in line with circular economy principles including but not limited to minimising waste, maintaining the value of products, materials and other resources at their highest value and enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption;

(d) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies, arising from resource use and circular economy, and how the undertaking manages them; and

(e) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on resource use and circular economy.

This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to “resource use” and “circular economy” and in particular on:

(a) resource inflows including the circularity of material resource inflows, considering renewable and non-renewable resources; and

(b) resource outflows including information on products and materials; and

(c) waste.

Circular economy means an economic system in which the value of products, materials and other resources in the economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle, including through the application of the waste hierarchy. The goal is to maximise and maintain the value of the technical and biological resources, products and materials by creating a system that allows for durability, optimal use or re-use, refurbishment, remanufacturing, recycling and nutrient cycling.

This Standard builds on relevant EU legislative frameworks and policies including the EU Circular Economy Action Plan, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (83) (Waste Framework Directive) and the EU industrial strategy.

To evaluate the transition from business as usual, meaning an economy in which finite resources are extracted to make products that are used and then thrown away (“take-make-waste”), to a circular economic system, this Standard relies on the identification of the physical flows of resources, materials and products used and generated by the undertaking through Disclosure Requirement E5-4 Resource inflows and Disclosure Requirement E5-5 Resource outflows.

Resource use is a major driver of other environmental impacts such as climate change, pollution, water and marine resources and biodiversity. A circular economy is a system that tends towards sustainable use of resources in extraction, processing, production, consumption and management of waste. Such system brings multiple environmental benefits, in particular, the reduction of material and energy consumption and emissions into the air (greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution), the limitation of water withdrawals and discharges and the regeneration of nature limiting the impact on biodiversity.

To provide a comprehensive overview of which other environmental matters could be material to resource use and circular economy, relevant disclosure requirements are covered in other environmental ESRS as follows:

(a) ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses, in particular, GHG emissions and energy resources (energy consumption);

(b) ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses, in particular, emissions to water, air and soil as well as substances of concern;

Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3).

OJ L, 22.12.2023

(c) ESRS E3 Water and marine resources, which addresses, in particular, water resource (water consumption) and marine resources; and

(d) ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems, which addresses, in particular, ecosystems, species and raw materials.

8. The undertaking’s impacts related to resource use and circular economy, in particular impacts related to waste, can affect people and communities. Material negative impacts on affected communities from resource use and circular economy attributable to the undertaking are covered in ESRS S3 Affected communities. The efficient and circular use of resources also benefits competitiveness and economic wellbeing.

9. This Standard should be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures.

# Appendix A

# Application Requirements

This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS E5. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.

ESRS 2 GENERAL DISCLOSURES

Impact, risk and opportunity management

Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material resource use and circular economy-related impacts, risks and opportunities

AR 1. When conducting a materiality assessment on environmental subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the materiality of resource use and circular economy in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, and may consider the four phases below, also known as the LEAP approach:

|(a) Phase 1:|locate where in the undertaking’s own operations and along its upstream and downstream value chain the interface with nature takes place;|
|---|---|
|(b) Phase 2:|evaluate the dependencies and impacts;|
|(c) Phase 3:|assess the material risks and opportunities;|
|(d) Phase 4:|prepare and report the results of the materiality assessment.|

AR 2. With regard to ESRS E5, phases 1 and 2 rely mainly on the materiality assessments conducted under ESRS E1 (including energy consumption), ESRS E2 (pollution), ESRS E3 (marine resources, water consumption) and ESRS E4 (biodiversity, ecosystems, raw materials). Indeed, circular economy eventually aims at reducing the environmental impact of the use of products, materials and other resources, minimizing waste and the release of hazardous substances and hence at reducing impacts on nature. This application requirement focuses mainly on the third phase of this LEAP approach, while the fourth phase addresses the outcome of the process.

AR 3. The process to assess the materiality of impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities shall consider the provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities and IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement.

AR 4. The sub-topics related to resource use and circular economy covered by the materiality assessment include:

(a) resource inflows including pe circularity of material resource inflows, considering resource use optimisation, intensity of materials and products and renewable and non-renewable resources;
(b) resource outflows related to products and services;
(c) waste, including hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste management.

AR 5. In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking may:

(a) identify transition risks and opportunities in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including pe risk of staying in a business-as-usual scenario:
i. policy and legal, e.g., bans on pe extraction and use of non-renewable resources, regulations on waste treatment;
ii. technology, e.g., introduction on pe market of new technologies to replace existing use of products and materials;
iii. market, e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing;
iv. reputation, e.g. changing societal, customer or community perceptions.

(b) identify physical risks including depletion of stock and use of virgin and non-virgin renewable resources, and of non-renewable resources;

(c) identify opportunities categorised by:

- resource efficiency: e.g., transition to more efficient services and processes requiring less resources, eco-design for longevity, repair, reuse, recycle, by-products, take-back systems, decoupling activity from extraction of materials, intensifying circular material use, creation of a system that allows for dematerialization (e.g., digitisation, improving utilisation rates, weight reduction); practices to ensure products and materials are collected, sorted, and reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured;
- markets: e.g., demand for less resource-intense products and services, and new consumption models such as product-as-a-service, pay-per-use, sharing, leasing;
- financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;
- resilience: e.g., diversification of resources and business activities (e.g., start a new business unit to recycle new materials), investing in green infrastructures, adopting recycling and circularity mechanisms that reduce the dependencies, capability of the undertaking to safeguard future stocks and flows of resources; and
- reputation.

AR 6. The undertaking may consider the following methodologies to assess its impacts, risks and opportunities in its own operations and along its upstream and downstream value chain:

# Objective

The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand the undertaking’s material impacts on its own workforce, as well as related material risks and opportunities, including:

1. how the undertaking affects its own workforce, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
2. any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
3. the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on its own workforce, and how the undertaking manages them; and
4. the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on its own workforce.
---
# In order to meet the objective, this Standard also requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on its own workforce in relation to the following social, including human rights, factors or matters:

|(a) working conditions, including:|i. secure employment;|
|---|---|
| |ii. working time;|
| |iii. adequate wages;|
| |iv. social dialogue;|
| |v. freedom of association, the existence of works councils and the information, consultation and participation rights of workers;|
| |vi. collective bargaining, including the rate of the undertaking’s workforce covered by collective agreements;|
| |vii. work-life balance;|
| |viii. health and safety.|

|(b) equal treatment and opportunities for all, including:|i. gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value;|
|---|---|
| |ii. training and skills development;|
| |iii. employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities;|
| |iv. measures against violence and harassment in the workplace; and|
| |v. diversity.|

|(c) other work-related rights, including those that relate to:|i. child labour;|
|---|---|
| |ii. forced labour;|
| |iii. adequate housing; and|
| |iv. privacy.|

# This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on its own workforce, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking.

For example, on the matter of equal opportunities, discrimination in hiring and promotion against women can reduce the undertaking’s access to qualified labour and harm its reputation. Conversely, policies to increase the representation of women in the workforce and in upper levels of management can have positive effects, such as increasing the pool of qualified labour and improving the undertaking’s reputation.

# This Standard covers an undertaking’s own workforce, which is understood to include both people who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking (“employees”) and non-employees who are either people with contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self-employed people”) or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78).

See Application Requirement 3 for examples of who falls under own workforce. The information required to be disclosed with regard to non-employees shall not affect their status pursuant to applicable labour law.

# This Standard does not cover workers in the undertaking’s upstream or downstream value chain; these categories of workers are covered in ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain.

# The Standard requires undertakings to describe their own workforce, including key characteristics of the employees and non-employees that are part of it.

This description provides users with an understanding of the structure of the undertaking’s own workforce and helps to contextualize information provided through other disclosures.
---
# 7. The objective of the Standard

The objective of the Standard is also to enable users to understand the extent to which the undertaking aligns or complies with international and European human rights instruments and conventions, including the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and ILO fundamental conventions, the UN Convention on Persons with Disabilities, the European Convention of Human Rights, the revised European Social Charter, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the EU policy priorities as set out by the European Pillar of Social Rights, and Union legislation, including the EU labour law acquis.

# Interaction with other ESRS

This Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General principles and ESRS 2 General requirements.

This Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain, ESRS S3 Affected communities and ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users.

The reporting under this Standard shall be consistent, coherent and where relevant clearly linked with reporting on the undertaking’s own workforce under ESRS S2, in order to ensure effective reporting.

# Disclosure requirements

# Appendix A

# Application Requirements

This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S1 Own workforce. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of this Standard.

Objective

AR 1. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of its own workforce during a pandemic.

AR 2. The overview of social matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be reported on in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, they provide a list of matters derived from the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2013/34/EU that the undertaking shall consider for the ESRS 2 materiality assessment related to its own workforce and, as appropriate, report as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.

AR 3. Examples of people that fall within the scope of “Own workforce” are:

|(a) Examples of contractors (self-employed persons) in the undertaking’s own workforce include:|i. Contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee|
|---|---|
| |ii. Contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (e.g., on a road, on the street).|
| |iii. Contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the undertaking.|
|(b) Examples of people employed by a third party engaged in ‘employment activities’ include people who perform the same work that employees carry out, such as:|i. people who fill in for employees who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.);|
| |ii. people performing work additional to regular employees;|
| |iii. people who are dispatched temporarily from another EU member state to work for the undertaking (‘posted workers’).|

ESRS 2 General Disclosures

Strategy

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders

AR 4. ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of whether and how it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating significant material impacts on its own workforce, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.

AR 5. While the undertaking’s own workforce may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking shall consider the views of workers’ representatives when applicable to fulfil this disclosure.
---
# Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

AR 6. Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce can originate in its strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).

AR 7. Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of opportunities for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a “just transition”. Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.

AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking’s own workforce that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on “zero hours” contracts).

AR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on its own workforce where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking’s workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and own workforce.

# Impacts, risks and opportunities management

# Disclosure Requirement S1-1 – Policies related to own workforce

AR 10. The undertaking shall consider whether explanations of significant changes to the policies adopted during the reporting year provide contextual information for users and may disclose such explanations. This includes policies and commitments of the undertaking to prevent or mitigate the risks and negative impacts on people in its own workforce of reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to greener and climate-neutral operations as well as to provide opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling, including explicit commitments to a ‘just transition’.

AR 11. The policy may take the form of a stand-alone policy regarding the undertaking’s own workforce or be included in a broader document such as a code of ethics or a general sustainability policy that has already been disclosed by the undertaking as part of another ESRS. In those cases, the undertaking shall provide an accurate cross-reference to identify the aspects of the policy that satisfy the requirements of this Disclosure Requirement.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 181/284
---
# AR 12

When disclosing the alignment of its policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the undertaking shall consider that the Guiding Principles refer to the International Bill of Human Rights, which consist of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants that implement it, as well as the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work and the core conventions that underpin it, and may report on alignment with these instruments.

# AR 13

When explaining how external-facing policies are embedded, the undertaking may, for example, consider internal policies of responsible sourcing, and alignment with other policies relevant to own workers, for example, regarding forced labour. With regard to supplier codes of conduct that the undertaking may have, it shall indicate whether they include provisions addressing the safety of workers, precarious work (i.e., use of workers on short-term or limited hours contracts, workers employed via third parties, sub-contracting to third parties or use of informal workers), human trafficking, the use of forced labour or child labour, and whether such provisions are fully in line with applicable ILO standards.

# AR 14

The undertaking may provide an illustration of the types of communication of its policies to those individuals, group of individuals or entities for whom they are relevant, either because they are expected to implement them (for example, the undertaking’s employees, contractors and suppliers), or because they have a direct interest in their implementation (for example, people in its own workforce, investors). It may disclose communication tools and channels (for example, flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face interactions, workers’ representatives), aimed at ensuring that the policy is accessible and that different audiences understand its implications. The undertaking may also explain how it identifies and removes potential barriers for dissemination, such as through translation into relevant languages or the use of graphic depictions.

# AR 15

Discrimination in employment and occupation occurs when someone is treated differently or less favourably because of characteristics that are not related to merit or the inherent requirements of the job. These characteristics are commonly defined in national laws. Besides the grounds mentioned in the Disclosure Requirement, the undertaking shall consider other grounds for discrimination prohibited under national legislation.

# AR 16

Discrimination can arise in a variety of work-related activities. These include access to employment, particular occupations, training and vocational guidance and social security. Moreover, it can occur with respect to the terms and conditions of employment, such as: recruitment, remuneration, hours of work and rest, paid holidays, maternity protection, security of tenure, job assignments, performance assessment and advancement, training opportunities, promotion prospects, occupational safety and health, termination of employment. The undertaking may address these areas specifically when disclosing its policies and underlying procedures to fulfil the disclosure requirement.

# AR 17

The undertaking may disclose whether it:

- (a) has policies and procedures which make qualifications, skills and experience the basis for the recruitment, placement, training and advancement at all levels, while accounting for the fact that some individuals may have more difficulty than others to acquire such qualifications, skills and experience;
- (b) assigns responsibility at top management level for equal treatment and opportunities in employment, issue clear company-wide policies and procedures to guide equal employment practices, and link advancement to desired performance in this area;
- (c) provides staff training on non-discrimination policies and practices, with a particular focus on middle and upper management to raise awareness and address resolution strategies for preventing and addressing systemic and incidental discrimination;
- (d) makes adjustments to the physical environment to ensure health and safety for workers, customers and other visitors with disabilities;
- (e) evaluates whether job requirements have been defined in a way that could systematically disadvantage certain groups;
---
# (f) keeps up-to-date records on recruitment, training and promotion that provide a transparent view of opportunities for employees and their progression within the undertaking;

# (g) puts in place grievance procedures to address complaints, handle appeals and provide recourse for employees (especially in the context of negotiations and collective agreements) when discrimination is identified, and is alert to formal structures and informal cultural issues that can prevent employees from raising concerns and grievances; and

# (h) has programs to promote access to skills development.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-2 – Processes for engaging with own workforce and workers' representatives about impacts

AR 18. When describing what function or role has operational responsibility for such engagement and/or ultimate accountability, the undertaking may disclose whether this is a dedicated role or function or part of a broader role or function, and whether any capacity building activities have been offered to support the staff to undertake engagement. If it cannot identify such a position or function, it may state that this is the case. This disclosure could also be fulfilled by making reference to information disclosed according to ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies.

AR 19. When preparing the disclosures described in paragraph 27 b) and c), the following illustrations may be considered:

- examples of stages at which engagement occurs are i) determining the approach to mitigation and ii) evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation;
- for type of engagement, these could be participation, consultation and/or information;
- for the frequency of the engagement, information may be provided on whether engagement occurs on a regular basis, at certain points in a project or business process, (for example, when a new harvest season begins or a new production line is opened), as well as whether it occurs in response to legal requirements and/or in response to stakeholder requests and whether the result of the engagement is being integrated into the undertaking's decision-making processes; and
- for the role with operational responsibility, whether the undertaking requires relevant staff to have certain skills, or whether it provides training or capacity building to relevant staff to undertake engagement.

AR 20. Global Framework Agreements (GFA) serve to establish an ongoing relationship between a multinational enterprise and a Global Union Federation to ensure that the undertaking adheres to the same standards in every country in which it operates.

AR 21. To illustrate how the perspectives of its own workforce have informed specific decisions or activities, the undertaking may provide examples from the current reporting period.

AR 22. Where the undertaking has agreements with national, European or international trade unions or works councils related to the rights of people its own workforce, this can be disclosed to illustrate how the agreement enables the undertaking to gain insight into the perspectives of such people.

AR 23. Where possible, the undertaking may disclose examples from the reporting period to illustrate how the perspectives of its own workforce and workers' representatives have informed specific decisions or activities of the undertaking.

AR 24. The undertaking shall consider the following aspects when fulfilling this Disclosure Requirement:

AR 25. The undertaking may also disclose the following information in relation to paragraph 24 on diversity:

(a) how it engages with at-risk or persons in vulnerable situations (for example whether it takes specific approaches and gives special attention to potential barriers);

(b) how it takes into account potential barriers to engagement with people in its workforce (for example, language and cultural differences, gender and power imbalances, divisions within a community or group);

(c) how it provides people in its workforce with information that is understandable and accessible through appropriate communication channels;

(d) any conflicting interests that have arisen among its workforce and how the undertaking has resolved these conflicting interests; and

(e) how it seeks to respect the human rights of all stakeholders engaged, for example, their rights to privacy, freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly and protest.

AR 26. The undertaking may also report information about the effectiveness of processes for engaging with its own workforce from previous reporting periods. This applies in cases where the undertaking has assessed the effectiveness of these processes or derived lessons during the current reporting period. Processes used to track effectiveness can include internal or external auditing or verification, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.

Disclosure Requirement S1-3 – Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for own workers to raise concerns

AR 27. In fulfilling the requirements set out by the disclosure criteria of Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-3, the undertaking may be guided by the content of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct focused on remediation and grievance mechanisms.

AR 28. Channels for raising concerns or needs include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, trade unions (where people in the workforce are unionized), works councils, dialogue processes or other means through which the undertaking’s own workforce or workers’ representatives can raise concerns about impacts or explain needs that they would like the undertaking to address. This could include both channels provided by the undertaking directly and channels provided by the entities where their own workforce is working, in addition to any other mechanisms an undertaking may use to gain insight into the management of impacts on its own workforce, such as compliance audits. Where the undertaking is relying solely on information about the existence of such channels provided by its business relationships to answer this requirement, it may state that.
---
# AR 29

Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other collaborative initiatives. The undertaking may disclose whether these are accessible to all of its own workforce (or workers’ representatives or, in their absence, individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts).

# AR 30

The undertaking shall consider whether and how people in its own workforce that may be affected and their workers' representatives are able to access channels at the level of the undertaking they are employed by, or contracted to work for, in relation to each material impact. Relevant channels may include hotlines, trade unions (where people in the workforce are unionised) or works councils, or other grievance mechanisms operated by the relevant undertaking or by a third party.

# AR 31

In explaining whether and how the undertaking knows that people in its own workforce are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of the people concerned. Examples of sources of information are surveys of people in the undertaking’s workforce that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes.

# AR 32

In describing the effectiveness of channels for its own workforce and workers’ representatives to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in particular principle 31. The considerations below may be applied to individual channels or to a collective system of channels:

- (a) do the channels have legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?
- (b) are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?
- (c) do the channels have clear and known procedures, with indicative timeframes?
- (d) do the channels ensure reasonable access for stakeholders to sources of information, advice and expertise?
- (e) do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and, where applicable, to meet any public interest?
- (f) do outcomes achieved through the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?
- (g) does the undertaking identify insights from the channels that support continuous learning in both improving the channels and preventing future impacts?
- (h) does the undertaking focus on dialogue with complainants as the means to reach agreed solutions, rather than seeking to unilaterally determine the outcome?

# Disclosure Requirement S1-4 – Taking action on material impacts and approaches to mitigating material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to own workforce, and effectiveness of those actions and approaches

# AR 33

It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its own workforce, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice). Therefore, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;
- (b) its initiatives aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;
- (c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and
- (d) its aims for continued improvement.

# AR 34

Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether it is involved because the impact is directly linked to its operations, products or services by a business relationship.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 185/284
---
# AR 35

Given that material negative impacts affecting its own workforce that have occurred during the reporting period may also be connected with other entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage in its business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on workers’ rights to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationship) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible recruitment or ensuring workers receive an adequate wage).

# AR 36

When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may report under ESRS S1-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.

# AR 37

When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on its own workforce in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.

# AR 38

Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.

# AR 39

Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by an undertaking and the effective management of impacts. Additional information that the undertaking may provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified.

# AR 40

With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for people in the undertaking’s own workforce that are based on their needs, and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:

(a) information about wheper and how people in its own workforce and workers’ representatives play a role in decisions regarding pe design and implementation of pese programmes or processes;
(b) information about pe intended or achieved positive outcomes for pe undertaking’s own workforce of pese programmes or processes.

# AR 41

The undertaking may explain whether any such initiatives are designed also to support the achievement of one or more Sustainable Development Goals. For example, an undertaking committing to SDG 8 to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” may be actively working towards eliminating forced labour or compulsory labour or supporting higher levels of productivity on activities in developing countries through technological upgrades and training of local labour, which can benefit both the specific people in its own workforce targeted by the actions, and also their local communities.

# AR 42

When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for the undertaking’s own workforce, a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of people have received financial literacy training) from evidence of actual outcomes for the people concerned (for example, that x people report that they are able to better manage their pay and their household budgets).

# AR 43

If the undertaking has taken measures to mitigate negative impacts on its own workforce that arise from the transition to a greener, climate-neutral economy, such as training and reskilling, employment guarantees, and in the case of downscaling or mass dismissal, measures such as job counselling, coaching, intra-company placements and early retirement plans, the undertaking shall disclose those measures. This includes measures to

# Metrics and targets

Disclosure Requirement S1-5 – Targets related to managing material impacts, advancing positive impacts, as well as to risks and opportunities

AR 49. When disclosing information about targets in accordance with paragraph 46, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of a certain number of people in its own workforce;
- (b) the stability of the targets over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability over time; and/or
- (c) the standards or commitments which the targets are based on (for instance codes of conduct, sourcing policies, global frameworks, or industry codes).

AR 50. Targets related to risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets related to impacts. For example, a target to reach adequate wages for non-employees could both reduce impacts on those people and reduce associated risks in terms of the quality and reliability of their output.

AR 51. The undertaking may also distinguish between short-, medium- and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have a long-term target to achieve an 80% reduction in health and safety incidents affecting its delivery drivers by 2030 and a near-term target to reduce the overtime hours of delivery drivers by x% while maintaining their income by 2024.

# AR 52

When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-6 – Characteristics of the Undertaking’s Employees

# AR 53

This Disclosure Requirement covers all employees who perform work for any of the undertaking’s entities included in its sustainability reporting.

# AR 54

Providing a breakdown of employees by country gives insight into the distribution of activity across countries. The number of employees in each country is also a key trigger for many information, consultation and participation rights for workers and workers' representatives, both in the Union labour law acquis (for example, Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council “European Works Councils Directive” and Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council “Information and Consultation Directive”) and in national law (for example, rights to establish a works council or to have board level employee representation). Providing a breakdown of employees by gender and type of employment relationship gives insight into gender representation across the undertaking. Additionally, providing a breakdown of employees by region gives insight into regional variations. A region can refer to a country or other geographic locations, such as a region within a country or a world region.

# AR 55

The undertaking shall disclose the requested disclosures in the following tabular formats:

| |Male|Female|Other|Not reported|Total Employees|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Number of employees (head count)| | | | |

In some Member States it is possible for persons to legally register themselves as having a third, often neutral, gender, which is categorized as “other” in the table above. However, if the undertaking is disclosing data about employees where this is not possible, it may explain this and indicate that the “other” category is not applicable.

| |Country A|Country B|
|---|---|---|
| |Number of employees (head count)| |

(101) Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees (OJ L 122, 16.5.2009, p. 28).

# AR 56

The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees differ between countries. If the undertaking has employees in more than one country, it shall use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data shall then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions. Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the undertaking without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is not contractually obliged to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fall under this category.

# AR 57

Disclosing the number of employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.

# AR 58

Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time employees, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose contextual information to help information users interpret the data. The undertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.

# AR 59

For the own employee turnover calculation, the undertaking shall calculate the aggregate of the number of employees who leave voluntarily or due to dismissal, retirement, or death in service. The undertaking shall use this number for the numerator of the employee turnover rate and may determine the denominator used to calculate this rate and describe its methodology.

# AR 60

Where data is not available for detailed information, the undertaking shall use an estimation of the employee number or ratios, in accordance with ESRS 1, and clearly identify where the use of estimates has taken place.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-7 – Characteristics of non-employees in the undertaking’s own workforce

# AR 61

This Disclosure Requirement provides insight into the undertaking’s approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures. This disclosure covers both individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (“self-employed people”) and workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78). If all the people performing work for the undertaking are employees and the undertaking does not have any people in its workforce who are not employees, this Disclosure Requirement is not material for the undertaking; notwithstanding, the undertaking may state this fact when disclosing the information required by Disclosure Requirement S1-6 as contextual information as this information can be relevant for the users of the Sustainability Statement.

# AR 62

Examples of contractors (self-employed people) in the undertaking’s own workforce include: contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee; contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (for example, on a road, on the street); and contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the organization. Examples of people employed by a third party engaged in ‘employment activities’ whose work is under the direction of the undertaking include: people who perform the same work that employees carry out, such as people who fill in for employees who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.); people performing regular work at the same site as employees; and workers who are dispatched temporarily from another EU member state to work for the undertaking (‘posted workers’). Examples of value chain workers (and thus of workers not in the
---
undertaking’s own workforce and reported under the scope of ESRS S2) include: workers for a supplier contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier’s premises using the supplier’s work methods; workers for a ‘downstream’ entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking; and workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at one or more of the undertaking’s workplaces, perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (for example, photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking.

AR 63. If the undertaking cannot report exact figures, it shall use estimates according to the provisions in ESRS 1 to disclose the number of people in its own workforce who are not employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of people in its own workforce who are not employees is greater than 1 000, to the nearest 100, and explain this. In addition, it shall clearly identify the information that derives from actual data and estimates.

AR 64. Disclosing the number of people in the undertaking’s own workforce who are not employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing this number as an average across the reporting period considers fluctuations during the reporting period and can provide more insightful and relevant information for users.

AR 65. The information disclosed by the undertaking allows users to understand how the number of non-employees in the undertaking’s own workforce varies during the reporting period or compared to the previous reporting period (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). The undertaking may also disclose the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of non-employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of non-employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project. If the undertaking discloses fluctuations, it shall also explain the criteria used to determine which fluctuations it discloses. If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of non-employees during the reporting period or between the current and previous reporting period, the undertaking may disclose this information.

Disclosure Requirement S1-8 – Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue

Collective bargaining coverage

AR 66. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements is calculated using the following formula:Number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 100 Number of employees

AR 67. The employees in the undertaking’s own workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements are those individuals to whom the undertaking is obliged to apply the agreement. This means that if none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee in the undertaking’s own workforce covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be counted once.

AR 68. This requirement is not aimed at obtaining the percentage of employees represented by a works council or belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be higher than the percentage of unionised employees when the collective bargaining agreements apply to both union and non-union members. Alternatively, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be lower than the percentage of unionised employees. This may be the case when there are no collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective bargaining agreements do not cover all unionised employees.
---
# Social Dialogue

AR 69. For calculating the information required by paragraph 63(a), the undertaking shall identify in which European Economic Area (EEA) countries it has significant employment (i.e., at least 50 employees representing at least 10% of its total employees). For these countries it shall report the percentage of employees in that country which are employed in establishments in which employees are represented by workers’ representatives. Establishment is defined as any place of operations where the undertaking carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. Examples include: a factory, a branch of a retail chain, or an undertaking’s headquarters. For countries in which there is only one establishment the percentage reported shall be either 100% or 0%.

Number of employees working in establishments with workers representatives
AR 70. The information required by this Disclosure Requirement shall be reported as follows

Reporting template for collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue
AR 71. In preparing the disclosure on gender at top management, the undertaking shall use the definition of top management as one and two levels below the administrative and supervisory bodies unless this concept has already been defined with the undertaking’s operations and differs from the previous description. If this is the case, the undertaking can use its own definition for top management and disclose that fact and its own definition.

Disclosure Requirement S1-10 – Adequate Wages

AR 72. The lowest wage shall be calculated for the lowest pay category, excluding interns and apprentices. This is to be based on the basic wage plus any fixed additional payments that are guaranteed to all employees. The lowest wage shall be considered separately for each country in which the undertaking has operations, except outside the EEA when the relevant adequate or minimum wage is defined at a sub national level.

AR 73. The adequate wage benchmark used for comparison with the lowest wage shall not be lower than: (a) in the EEA: the minimum wage set in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2041 of the European Parliament and of the Council (103) on adequate minimum wages in the European Union. In the period until Directive (EU) 2022/2041 enters into application, where there is no applicable minimum wage determined by legislation or collective bargaining in an EEA country, the undertaking shall use an adequate wage

(103) Directive (EU) 2022/2041 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on adequate minimum wages in the European Union (OJ L 275, 25.10.2022, p. 33).
---
# Directive (EU) 2022/2041 on adequate minimum wages

The directive in the European Union references both indicative reference values commonly used at the international level such as 60% of the gross median wage and 50% of the gross average wage, as well as indicative reference values used at the national level. Data for the indicative values of 60% of the national median gross wage or 50% of the national average gross wage can be obtained from the European Labour Force Survey.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-11 – Social protection

Social protection refers to all the measures that provide access to health care and income support in cases of challenging life events such as the loss of a job, being sick and in need of medical care, giving birth and raising a child, or retiring and in need of a pension.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-12 – Persons with disabilities

When disclosing the information required regarding persons with disabilities, the undertaking shall provide any contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). For example, information about the impact of different legal definitions of persons with disabilities in the different countries in which the undertaking has operations.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-13 – Training and Skills Development metrics

A regular performance review is defined as a review based on criteria known to the employee and his or her superior undertaken with the knowledge of the employee at least once per year. The review can include an evaluation by the worker’s direct superior, peers, or a wider range of employees. The review can also involve the human resources department. In order to disclose the information required, the undertaking shall use the employee headcount figures provided in Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-6 in the denominator to calculate the:

- (a) number/proportion of performance reviews per employee;
- (b) number of reviews in proportion to the agreed number of reviews by the management.

To disclose the average required, the undertaking shall perform the following calculation: total number of training hours offered to and completed by employees per gender category divided by the total number of employees per gender category. For the total training average and the average by gender, the headcount figures for total employment and employment by gender reported in Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-6 shall be used.
---
# AR 79. Employee categories

Employee categories are a breakdown of employees by level (such as senior management, middle management) or function (such as technical, administrative, production). This information is derived from the undertaking’s own human resources system. In categorising the workforce, the undertaking shall define reasonable and meaningful employee categories which enable users of the information to understand different performance measures between the categories. The undertaking may present a category for executive and non-executive employees.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-14 – Health and safety metrics

# AR 80. Health and safety management system coverage

In relation to paragraph 88 (a), the percentage of its own workforce who are covered by the undertaking’s health and safety management system shall be disclosed on a head count basis rather than a full-time equivalent basis.

# AR 81. Internal audit or external certification

With regard to paragraph 90, when the undertaking’s health and safety management system, or certain parts thereof, has been subject to an internal audit or external certification, the undertaking may state this fact, or absence thereof, and the underlying standards for such audits/certifications, as applicable.

# AR 82. Reporting of fatalities

Fatalities may be reported separately for those resulting from work-related injuries and those resulting from work-related ill health.

# Guidance on “work-related”

# AR 83. Definition of work-related incidents

Work-related injuries and work-related ill health arise from exposure to hazards at work. Notwithstanding, other types of incidents can occur that are not connected with the work itself. For example, the following incidents are generally not considered to be work-related, unless otherwise specified in applicable national legislation:

- (a) a person in the workforce suffers a heart attack while at work that is not connected with work;
- (b) a person in the workforce driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (when driving is not part of the work and where the transport has not been organised by the undertaking); and
- (c) a person in the workforce with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is not connected with work.

# AR 84. Traveling for work purposes

With regard to traveling for work purposes, injuries and ill health that occur while a person is traveling are work-related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the person was engaged in work activities “in the interest of the employer”. Examples of such activities include traveling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer). If the undertaking is responsible for the transport commuting, incidents occurred while commuting are considered to be work-related. Nonetheless, incidents which arise during travel, outside of the undertaking’s responsibility (i.e., regular commuting to and from work), may be reported separately provided that the undertaking has such data available across the undertaking.

# AR 85. Working from home

With regard to working from home, injuries and ill health that occur when working from home are work-related if the injury or ill health occurs while the person is performing work from home; and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than the general home environment or setting.

# AR 86. Mental illness

With regard to mental illness, it is considered to be work-related if it has been notified voluntarily by the person concerned and it is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience; and if such opinion states that the illness is work-related.
---
# AR 87

Health issues resulting, for example, from smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and psychosocial factors unrelated to work are not considered work-related.

# AR 88

Occupational diseases are not considered work-related injuries but are covered under work-related ill health.

# Guidance on computing the rate of work-related injuries

# AR 89

In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its own workforce and multiplied by 1 000 000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1 000 000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-time people in the workforce over a 1-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1 000 000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 people in the workforce.

# AR 90

If the undertaking cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from work (for example, paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its disclosures.

# AR 91

An undertaking shall include fatalities as a result of work-related injury in the calculation of the number and rate of recordable work-related injuries.

# Guidance on recordable work-related ill health

# AR 92

Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or practices. These include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (for example, noise-induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (for example, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder). For the purpose of the required disclosures, the undertaking shall, at a minimum, include in its disclosure those cases outlined in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases.

# AR 93

In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under work-related ill health (and not injuries).

# AR 94

The cases to be disclosed in paragraph 88(d) relate to cases of work-related ill health notified to the undertaking or identified by the undertaking through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The undertaking might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected people, compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected during the reporting period among people who were formerly in the undertaking’s workforce.

# Guidance on the number of days lost

# AR 95

The undertaking shall count the number of days lost such that the first full day and last day of absence shall be included. Calendar days should be considered for the calculation, thus days on which the affected individual is not scheduled for work (for example, weekends, public holidays) will count as lost days.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-15 – Work-life balance

# AR 96

Family-related leave includes maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers’ leave that is available under national law or collective agreements. For the purpose of this Standard, these concepts are defined as: (a) maternity leave (also called pregnancy leave): employment-protected leave of absence for employed women directly around the time of childbirth (or, in some countries, adoption);
---
# (b) paternity leave:

leave from work for fathers or, where and in so far as recognised by national law, for equivalent second parents, on the occasion of the birth or adoption of a child for the purposes of providing care;

# (c) parental leave:

leave from work for parents on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child to take care of that child, as defined by each Member State;

# (d) carers’ leave from work:

leave for workers to provide personal care or support to a relative, or a person who lives in the same household, in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason, as defined by each Member State.

# AR 97.

With regard to paragraph 93 (a), employees entitled to family-related leave are those who are covered by regulations, organisational policies, agreements, contracts or collective bargaining agreements that contain family-related leave entitlements and have reported their entitlement to the undertaking or the undertaking is aware of the entitlement.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-16 – Remuneration metrics (pay gap and total remuneration)

# Pay gap

# AR 98.

When compiling the information required under paragraph 97 (a) for the gap in pay between its female and male employees (also known as the “gender pay gap”) the undertaking shall use the following methodology:

- include all employees’ gross hourly pay level; and
- apply the following formula to calculate the gender pay gap: (Average gross hourly pay level of male employees - average gross hourly pay level of female employees) x 100 / Average gross hourly pay level of male employees

# AR 99.

When disclosing the information required under paragraph 97 (a), the undertaking shall provide any contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). Information regarding how objective factors such as type of work and country of employment influence the gender pay gap may be reported.

# AR 100.

The measure of the undertaking’s gender pay gap shall be reported for the current reporting period and, if reported in previous sustainability reports, for the previous two reporting periods.

# Total remuneration Ratio

# AR 101.

When compiling the information required by paragraph 97 (b), the undertaking shall:

- include all employees;
- consider, depending on the undertaking’s remuneration policies, all of the following:
- base salary, which is the sum of guaranteed, short-term, and non-variable cash compensation;
- benefits in cash, which is the sum of the base salary and cash allowances, bonuses, commissions, cash profit-sharing, and other forms of variable cash payments;
- benefits in kind, such as cars, private health insurance, life insurance, wellness programs;
- direct remuneration, which is the sum of benefits in cash, benefits in kind and total fair value of all annual long-term incentives (for example, stock option awards, restricted stock shares or units, performance stock shares or units, phantom stock shares, stock appreciation rights, and long-term cash awards).
---
# AR 102

To illustrate the contextual information, the undertaking may provide an explanation to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). Quantitative data, such as the annual total remuneration ratio, may not be sufficient on its own to understand pay disparity and its drivers. For example, pay ratios can be influenced by the size of the undertaking (for example, revenue, number of employees), its sector, its employment strategy (for example, reliance on outsourced workers or part-time employees, a high degree of automation), or currency volatility.

# Disclosure Requirement S1-17 – Incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts

# AR 103

In addition to the information required by paragraphs 103 and 104, the undertaking may disclose the status of incidents and/or complaints and actions taken with reference to the following:

- (a) incidents reviewed by the undertaking;
- (b) remediation plans being implemented;
- (c) remediation plans that have been implemented, with results reviewed through routine internal management review processes; and
- (d) incidents no longer subject to action.

# AR 104

If the undertaking compiles the information described in AR 105, it shall consider the following:

- (a) an incident is no longer subject to action if it is resolved, the case is completed, or no further action is required by the undertaking. For example, an incident for which no further action is required can include cases that are withdrawn or where the underlying circumstances that led to the incident no longer exist;
- (b) remedial action is directed toward the alleged harasser and the alleged victim. Remedial action toward the victim may include offering to pay his/her expenses for counselling sessions, offering the victim some paid time off, offering to reinstate sick/vacation days if the victim has incurred any expenses due to the harassment (such as having used sick or vacation days); and
- (c) remedial action toward the harasser may include giving the harasser a verbal and/or written warning, mandating anti-harassment counselling or sending the harasser to an appropriate seminar, harassment awareness and prevention training. A suspension without pay may also be an option. If the harasser has been disciplined earlier but his/her harassment does not cease, then more serious discipline may be required.

# AR 105

Severe human rights incidents include instances of lawsuits, formal complaints through the undertaking or third-party complaint mechanisms, serious allegations in public reports or the media, where these are connected to the undertaking’s own workforce, and the fact of the incidents is not disputed by the undertaking, as well as any other severe impacts of which the undertaking is aware.

# AR 106

In addition to the information required by paragraph 104 above, the undertaking may disclose the number of severe human rights incidents where the undertaking played a role securing remedy for those affected during the reporting period.

# Objective

The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on value chain workers connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including:

- how the undertaking affects workers in its value chain, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
- any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
- the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities, including those related to its impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain, and how the undertaking manages them; and
- the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities, including those arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain.

# In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on value chain workers in relation to:

- working conditions (for example, secure employment, working time, adequate wage, social dialogue, freedom of association, including the existence of work councils, collective bargaining, work-life balance and health and safety);
- equal treatment and opportunities for all (for example, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, the employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities, measures against violence and harassment in the workplace, and diversity);
- other work-related rights (for example, child labour, forced labour, adequate housing, water and sanitation and privacy).

# This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking.

For example, negative impacts on value chain workers may disrupt the undertaking’s operations (through customers refusing to buy its products or state agencies impounding its goods) and harm its reputation. Conversely, respect for workers’ rights and active support programmes (for example through financial literacy initiatives) can bring business opportunities, such as more reliable supply or widening of the future consumer base.

# This Standard covers all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking, including impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships.

This includes all workers who are not included in the scope of “own workforce” (“own workforce” includes employees, individual contractors, i.e., self-employed workers, and workers provided by third party undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’). Own workforce is covered in ESRS S1 Own workforce. See AR 3 for examples of what is included in the scope of this Standard.

# Interaction with other ESRS

This Standard applies when material impacts on and/or material risks and opportunities related to value chain workers have been identified through the materiality assessment process laid out in ESRS 2 General disclosures.

This Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements, and ESRS 2, as well as the ESRS S1, ESRS S3 Affected communities and ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users.

The reporting under this Standard shall be consistent, coherent and where relevant clearly linked with reporting on the undertaking’s own workforce under ESRS S1, in order to ensure effective reporting.

# Disclosure Requirements

# ESRS 2 General disclosures

8. The requirements of this section should be read in conjunction with the disclosures required by ESRS 2 on Strategy (SBM). The resulting disclosures shall be presented alongside the disclosures required by ESRS 2, except for SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model, for which the undertaking has an option to present the disclosures alongside the topical disclosure.

# Strategy

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 Interests and views of stakeholders

9. When responding to ESRS 2 SBM-2 paragraph 43, the undertaking shall disclose how the interests, views, and rights of its value chain workers could be materially impacted by the undertaking, including respect for their human rights, inform its strategy and business model. Value chain workers are a key group of affected stakeholders.

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

10. When responding to ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48, the undertaking shall disclose:

- (a) whether and how actual and potential impacts on value chain workers, as identified in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities: (i) originate from or are connected to the undertaking’s strategy and business models, and (ii) inform and contribute to adapting the undertaking’s strategy and business model; and
- (b) the relationship between on the one hand its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on value chain workers, and on the other hand its strategy and business model.

11. When fulfilling the requirements of paragraph ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48, the undertaking shall disclose whether all value chain workers who are likely to be materially impacted by the undertaking, including impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, are included in the scope of its disclosure under ESRS 2. In addition, the undertaking shall provide the following information:

- (a) a brief description of the types of value chain workers who could be materially impacted by the undertaking, including impacts that connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and specify whether they are:

# (b) any geographies, at country level or other levels, or commodities for which there is a significant risk of child labour, or of forced labour or compulsory labour, among workers in the undertaking’s value chain (104);

# (c) in the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the undertaking operates or has sourcing or other business relationships (e.g., child labour or forced labour in particular commodity supply chains in specific countries or regions), or (ii) related to individual incidents (e.g., an industrial accident or an oil spill) or to specific business relationships. This includes consideration of impacts on value chain workers that may arise from the transition to greener and climate-neutral operations. Potential impacts include impacts associated with innovation and restructuring, closure of mines, increased mining of minerals needed for the transition to a sustainable economy, and solar panel production;

# (d) in the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts (e.g., updated purchasing practices, capacity-building to supply chain workers), including providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a ‘just transition’, and the types of value chain workers that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions; and

# (e) any material risks and opportunities for the undertaking arising from impacts and dependencies on value chain workers.

# 12. In describing the main types of value chain workers who are or could be negatively affected, based on the materiality assessment set out in ESRS 2 IRO-1, the undertaking shall disclose whether and how it has developed an understanding of how workers with particular characteristics, those working in particular contexts, or those undertaking particular activities may be at greater risk of harm.

# 13. The undertaking shall disclose which, if any, of its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on its value chain workers relate to specific groups of value chain workers (for example, particular age groups, workers in a particular factory or country) rather than to all of the value chain workers.

# Impact, risk and opportunity management

# Disclosure Requirement S2-1 – Policies related to value chain workers

# 14. The undertaking shall describe its policies adopted to manage its material impacts on value chain workers, as well as associated material risks and opportunities.

# 15. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the extent to which the undertaking has policies that address the identification, assessment, management and/or remediation of material impacts on value chain workers specifically, as well as policies that cover material risks or opportunities related to value chain workers.

# 16. The disclosure required by paragraph 14 shall contain the information on the undertaking’s policies to manage its material impacts, risks and opportunities related to value chain workers in accordance with ESRS 2 MDR-P Policies adopted to manage material sustainability matters. In addition, the undertaking shall specify whether such policies cover specific groups of value chain workers or all value chain workers.

# Appendix A

# Application Requirements

This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of ESRS S2.

Objective

AR 1. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of value chain workers during a pandemic.

AR 2. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to value chain workers and, as appropriate, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.

AR 3. Examples of workers that fall within the scope of this Standard are:

|(a)|workers of outsourced services working in the workplace of the undertaking (e.g., third party catering or security workers);|
|---|---|
|(b)|workers of a supplier contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier’s premises using the supplier’s work methods;|
|(c)|workers for a ‘downstream’ entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking;|
|(d)|workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at a workplace controlled by the undertaking, perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (e.g., photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking;|
|(e)|workers deeper in the supply chain who are extracting commodities that are then processed into components that go in the undertaking’s products.|

ESRS 2 General disclosures

Strategy

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 - Interests and views of stakeholders

AR 4. Disclosure Requirement ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of whether and how it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating significant material impacts on value chain workers, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.

AR 5. While value chain workers may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking may disclose the views of the value chain workers and value chain workers’ representatives.

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

AR 6. Impacts on value chain workers can originate in the undertaking’s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in the upstream and

210/284 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj
---
downstream value chains), its value chain (such as relying on commodities of unclear provenance, without visibility on impacts on workers), or its cost structure and the revenue model (e.g. shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of their workers).

AR 7. Impacts on value chain workers that originate in the strategy or the business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, undertakings that rely on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Another example is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure may sub-contract production, leading to lower quality, and a longer, less transparent, and less controllable supply chain. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.

AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of value chain workers that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 12 relate to young workers that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women workers in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrant workers in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some workers, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (e.g., workers required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid workers who are on “zero hours” contracts).

AR 9. With regard to paragraph 13, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on workers at all stages of the value chain resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting value chain workers working for logistics providers. For example, if some workers in the undertaking’s value chain are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour.

Impact, risk and opportunity management

Disclosure Requirement S2-1 – Policies related to value chain workers

AR 10. If the policies are limited to the undertaking’s own workforce and do not cover workers in upstream and downstream entities and relationships, they shall be disclosed under ESRS S1 and not in relation to this requirement.

AR 11. If the disclosures under ESRS S1 include information relevant for workers in the value chain, a reference to this can be made here; disclosures on the remaining elements shall then be fulfilled under this Disclosure Requirement.

AR 12. The undertaking may disclose explanations of significant changes to the policies adopted during the reporting year (e.g., new expectations for suppliers, new or additional approaches to due diligence and remedy).

AR 13. The policy may take the form of a stand-alone policy regarding value chain workers or be included in a broader document such as a code of ethics or a general sustainability policy that has already been disclosed by the undertaking as part of another ESRS. In those cases, the undertaking shall provide an accurate cross-reference to identify the aspects of the policy that satisfy the requirements of this Disclosure Requirement.

# AR 14

When disclosing the alignment of its policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the undertaking shall consider that the Guiding Principles refer to the International Bill of Rights, which consist of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants that implement it, as well as the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work and the core conventions that underpin it, and may disclose its alignment with these instruments.

# AR 15

When disclosing how external-facing policies are embedded, the undertaking may, for example, consider internal policies of responsible sourcing, and alignment with other policies relevant to value chain workers, for example, regarding forced labour. With regard to supplier codes of conduct that the undertaking may have, the summary shall indicate whether they include provisions addressing the safety of workers, precarious work (for example, the use of workers on short-term or limited hours contracts, workers employed via third parties, sub-contracting to third parties or use of informal workers), human trafficking, the use of forced labour or child labour, and whether such provisions are fully in line with applicable ILO standards.

# AR 16

The undertaking may provide an illustration of the types of communication of its policies to those individuals, group of individuals or entities for whom they are relevant, either because they are expected to implement them (for example, the undertaking’s employees, contractors and suppliers), or because they have a direct interest in their implementation (for example, own workers, investors). It may disclose communication tools and channels (for example, flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face interactions, workers’ representatives), aimed at ensuring that the policy is accessible and that different audiences understand its implications. The undertaking may also explain how it identifies and removes potential barriers for dissemination, such as through translation into relevant languages or the use of graphic depictions.

# Disclosure Requirement S2-2 – Processes for engaging with value chain workers about impacts

# AR 17

When describing which function or role has operational responsibility for such engagement and/or ultimate accountability, the undertaking may disclose whether this is a dedicated role or function or part of a broader role or function, and whether any capacity building activities have been offered to support the staff to undertake engagement. If it cannot identify such a position or function, it may state that this is the case. This disclosure could also be fulfilled by making reference to information disclosed according to ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies.

# AR 18

When preparing the disclosures described in paragraph 22 b) and c), the following illustrations may be considered:

- (a) examples of stages at which engagement occurs are i) determining the approach to mitigation and ii) evaluation the effectiveness of mitigation;
- (b) for type of engagement, these could be participation, consultation and/or information;
- (c) for the frequency of the engagement, information may be provided on whether engagement occurs on a regular basis, at certain points in a project or business process, for example, when a new harvest season begins or a new production line is opened, as well as whether it occurs in response to legal requirements and/or in response to stakeholder requests and whether the result of the engagement is being integrated into the undertaking's decision-making processes; and
- (d) for the role with operational responsibility, whether the undertaking requires relevant staff to have certain skills, or whether it provides training or capacity building to relevant staff to undertake engagement.

# AR 19

Global Framework Agreements (GFA) serve to establish an ongoing relationship between a multinational enterprise and a Global Union Federation to ensure that the undertaking adheres to the same standards in every country in which it operates.

# AR 20

To illustrate how the perspectives of value chain workers have informed specific decisions or activities of the undertaking, the undertaking may provide examples from the current reporting period.

# Disclosure Requirement S2-3 – Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise concerns

# AR 21

In fulfilling the requirements set out by Disclosure Requirement ESRS S2-3, the undertaking may be guided by the content of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises focused on remediation and grievance mechanisms.

# AR 22

Channels for raising concerns or needs include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, trade unions (where workers are unionised), dialogue processes or other means through which value chain workers or their legitimate representatives can raise concerns about impacts or explain needs that they would like the undertaking to address. This could include both channels provided by the undertaking directly and channels provided by the entities where the value chain workers are working, in addition to any other mechanisms the undertaking may use to gain insight into the management of impacts on workers, such as compliance audits. Where the undertaking is relying solely on information about the existence of such channels provided by its business relationships to answer this requirement, it may state that.

# AR 23

To provide greater insight into the information covered in Disclosure Requirement ESRS S2-3, the undertaking may explain whether and how value chain workers that may be affected are able to access channels at the level of the undertaking they are employed by, or contracted to work for, in relation to each material impact.

# AR 24

Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other collaborative initiatives. The undertaking may disclose whether these are accessible to all workers who may be potentially or actually materially impacted by the undertaking, or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts.

# AR 25

In relation to the protection of individuals that use the mechanisms against the retaliation, the undertaking may describe whether it treats grievances confidentially and with respect to the rights of privacy and data protection; and whether the mechanisms allow for workers to use them anonymously (for example, through representation by a third party).

# AR 26

In disclosing whether and how the undertaking knows that value chain workers are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of value chain workers themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of workers that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes.

# AR 27

In describing the effectiveness of channels for value chain workers to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in particular Principle 31. The below considerations may be applied to individual channels or to a collective system of channels:

- (a) do the channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?
- (b) are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?
- (c) do the channels have clear and known procedures, with indicative timeframes?
- (d) do the channels ensure reasonable access for stakeholders to sources of information, advice and expertise?
- (e) do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and, where applicable, to meet any public interest?

# Disclosure Requirement S2-4 – Taking action on material impacts on value chain workers, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to value chain workers, and effectiveness of those actions

AR 28. It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice. Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:

- (a) its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;
- (b) its initiatives aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;
- (c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and
- (d) its aims for continued improvement.

AR 29. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.

AR 30. Given that material negative impacts affecting value chain workers that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage in its business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on workers’ rights to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible recruitment or ensuring workers receive an adequate wage).

AR 31. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S2-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.

AR 32. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on value chain workers in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.

AR 33. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of its actions to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.

AR 34. Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.

AR 35. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by the undertaking and the effective management of impacts. For example, to show the effectiveness of its actions to support its suppliers with improving their working conditions, the undertaking may disclose survey feedback from the suppliers’ workers showing that working conditions have improved since the time the undertaking began working with those suppliers. Additional information that the undertaking may provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified through for instance, independent audits.
---
AR 36. With regard to initiatives or processes the undertaking has in place that are based on affected workers’ needs and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) information about whether and how value chain workers and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these programmes or processes; and
- (b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for value chain workers of these initiatives or processes.

AR 37. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for value chain workers are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 8 to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” the undertaking may be providing capacity-building to smallholders in its supply chain, resulting in increases in their income; or it may be supporting training to increase the proportion of women able to take delivery jobs in its downstream value chain.

AR 38. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for value chain workers a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (e.g., that x number of workers have received financial literacy training) from evidence of actual outcomes for workers (e.g., that x workers report that they are able to better manage their household budgets so as to meet their savings goals).

AR 39. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may e.g., consider programmes that aim to advance women workers’ financial literacy that have resulted in more women being promoted as well as in reports of reduced sexual harassment in the workplace.

AR 40. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on value chain workers, the undertaking may consider the following:

- (a) risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on value chain workers may include the reputational or legal exposure where value chain workers are found to be subject to forced labour or child labour;
- (b) risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers may include disruption of business operations where a pandemic closes significant parts of its supply chain or distribution network;
- (c) opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on value chain workers may include market differentiation and greater customer appeal from guaranteeing decent pay and conditions for non-employee workers; and
- (d) business opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers might include the achievement of a future sustainable supply of a commodity by ensuring smallholder farmers earn enough to persuade future generations to keep farming that crop.

AR 41. When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.

AR 42. When disclosing policies, actions and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.

AR 43. The undertaking shall consider whether and how its process(es) to manage material risks related to value chain workers are integrated into its existing risk management process(es).

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 215/284

# AR 44

When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.

# Metrics and targets

# Disclosure Requirement S2-5 – Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks and opportunities

# AR 45

When disclosing information about targets in accordance with paragraph 39, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of value chain workers, being as specific as possible;
- (b) the stability of the targets over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability over time;
- (c) the standards or commitments on which the targets are based (for instance codes of conduct, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).

# AR 46

Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets related to material impacts. For example, a target to reach living wages for supply chain workers could both reduce impacts on those workers and reduce associated risks in terms of the quality and reliability of supply.

# AR 47

The undertaking may also distinguish between short-, medium- and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have a long-term target to achieve an 80% reduction in health and safety incidents affecting the workers of a given supplier by 2030 and a near-term target to reduce their overtime hours of delivery drivers by x% while maintaining their income by 2024.

# AR 48

When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information, as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.

# Objective

1. The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on affected communities connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including:

- (a) how the undertaking affects communities, in areas where impacts are most likely to be present and severe, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
- (b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
- (c) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on affected communities, and how the undertaking manages them; and
- (d) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on affected communities.

2. In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on affected communities in relation to:

- (a) communities’ economic, social and cultural rights (for example, adequate housing, adequate food, water and sanitation, land-related and security-related impacts);
- (b) communities’ civil and political rights (for example, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, impacts on human rights defenders); and
- (c) particular rights of indigenous peoples (for example, free, prior and informed consent, self-determination, cultural rights).

3. This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative relationships with affected communities may disrupt the undertaking’s own operations or harm its reputation, while constructive relationships can bring business benefits, such as stable and conflict-free operations and a greater ease of recruiting locally.

# Interaction with other ESRS

4. This standard applies when material impacts on and/or material risks and opportunities related to affected communities have been identified through the materiality assessment process laid out in ESRS 2 General disclosures.

5. This Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements, and ESRS 2, as well as the ESRS S1 Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain and ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users.

# Disclosure Requirements

# ESRS 2 General disclosures

6. The requirements of this section should be read in conjunction with the disclosures required by ESRS 2 on Strategy (SBM). The resulting disclosures shall be presented alongside the disclosures required by ESRS 2, except for SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model, for which the undertaking has an option to present the disclosures alongside the topical disclosure.

# Strategy

# Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders

7. When responding to ESRS 2 SBM-2, paragraph 43, the undertaking shall disclose how the views, interests, and rights of affected communities, including respect for their human rights (and their rights as indigenous peoples, where applicable), inform its strategy and business model. Affected communities are a key group of affected stakeholders.

# Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

8. When responding to ESRS 2 SBM-3 paragraph 48, the undertaking shall disclose:

1. (a) whether and how actual and potential impacts on affected communities as identified in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities: (i) originate from or are connected to the undertaking’s strategy and business models, and (ii) inform and contribute to adapting the undertaking’s strategy and business model;
2. (b) the relationship between its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on affected communities and its strategy and business model.

9. When fulfilling the requirements of paragraph 48, the undertaking shall disclose whether all affected communities who are likely to be materially impacted by the undertaking, including impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, are included in the scope of its disclosure under ESRS 2. In addition, the undertaking shall provide the following information:

1. (a) a brief description of the types of communities subject to material impacts by its own operations or through its upstream and downstream value chain, and specify whether they are:

- communities living or working around the undertaking’s operating sites, factories, facilities or other physical operations, or more remote communities affected by activities at those sites (for example by downstream water pollution);
- communities along the undertaking’s value chain (for example, those affected by the operations of suppliers’ facilities or by the activities of logistics or distribution providers);
- communities at one or both endpoints of the value chain (for example, at the point of extraction of metals or minerals or harvesting of commodities, or communities around waste or recycling sites);
- communities of indigenous peoples.
2. (b) in the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the undertaking operates or has sourcing or other business relationships (for example, marginalised populations suffering impacts on their health and quality of life in a highly industrialised area), or (ii) related to individual incidents in the undertaking’s own operations (e.g., a toxic waste spill affecting a community’s access to clean drinking water) or in a specific business relationship (e.g., a peaceful protest by communities against business operations that was met with a violent response from the undertaking’s security services). This includes consideration of impacts on affected communities that may arise from the transition to greener and climate-neutral operations. Potential impacts include impacts associated with innovation and restructuring, closure of mines, increased mining of minerals needed for the transition to a sustainable economy and solar panel production;
3. (c) in the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts (for example, capacity-building to support more and new forms of local livelihoods) and the types of communities that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions; and
4. (d) any material risks and opportunities for the business arising from impacts and dependencies on affected communities.

The undertaking shall disclose whether and how it assesses that affected communities are aware of and trust these structures or processes as a way to raise their concerns or needs and have them addressed. In addition, the undertaking shall disclose whether it has policies in place regarding the protection of individuals that use them against retaliation. If such information has been disclosed in accordance with ESRS G1-1, the undertaking may refer to that information.

29. If the undertaking cannot disclose the above required information because it has not adopted a channel for raising concerns and/or does not support the availability of such a channel by its business relationships, it shall disclose this to be the case. It may disclose a timeframe in which it aims to have such a channel or processes in place.

# Disclosure Requirement S3-4 – Taking action on material impacts on affected communities, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to affected communities, and effectiveness of those actions

30. The undertaking shall disclose how it takes action to address material impacts on affected communities, and to manage material risks and pursue material opportunities related to affected communities and the effectiveness of those actions.

31. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is twofold. Firstly, it is to provide an understanding of any actions and initiatives through which the undertaking seeks to:

(a) prevent, mitigate and remediate the negative material impacts on affected communities; and/or

(b) achieve positive material impacts for affected communities.
---
Secondly, it is to enable an understanding of the ways in which the undertaking is addressing the material risks and pursuing the material opportunities related to affected communities.

The undertaking shall provide a summarised description of the action plans and resources to manage its material impacts, risks, and opportunities related to affected communities as per ESRS 2 MDR-A Actions and resources in relation to material sustainability matters.

In relation to material impacts, the undertaking shall describe:

- (a) actions taken, planned or underway to prevent or mitigate material negative impacts on affected communities;
- (b) whether and how it has taken action to provide or enable remedy in relation to an actual material impact;
- (c) any additional actions or initiatives it has in place with the primary purpose of delivering positive impacts for affected communities; and
- (d) how it tracks and assesses the effectiveness of these actions and initiatives in delivering intended outcomes for affected communities.

In relation to paragraph 29, the undertaking shall describe:

- (a) the processes through which it identifies what action is needed and appropriate in response to a particular actual or potential negative impact on affected communities;
- (b) its approach to taking action in relation to specific material negative impacts on communities, including any action in relation to its own practices regarding land acquisition, planning and construction, operation or closure practices, as well as whether wider industry or collaborative action with other relevant parties will be required; and
- (c) how it ensures that processes to provide or enable remedy in the event of material negative impacts are available and effective in their implementation and outcomes.

In relation to material risks and opportunities, the undertaking shall describe:

- (a) what action is planned or underway to mitigate material risks for the undertaking arising from its impacts and dependencies on affected communities and how it tracks effectiveness in practice; and
- (b) what action is planned or underway to pursue material opportunities for the undertaking in relation to affected communities.

The undertaking shall disclose whether and how it takes action to avoid causing or contributing to material negative impacts on affected communities through its own practices, including, where relevant, in relation to planning, land acquisition and exploitation, finance, extraction or production of raw materials, use of natural resources, and management of environmental impacts. This may include disclosing what approach is taken when tensions arise between the prevention or mitigation of material negative impacts and other business pressures.

The undertaking shall also disclose whether severe human rights issues and incidents connected to affected communities have been reported and, if applicable, disclose these.

When disclosing the information required under paragraph 31 (c), the undertaking shall consider ESRS 2 MDR-T Tracking effectiveness of policies and actions through targets if it evaluates the effectiveness of an action by setting a target.

This information supports the information needs of financial market participants subject to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 because it is derived from an additional indicator related to principal adverse impacts as set out by indicator #14 in Table III of Annex I of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 with regard to disclosure rules on sustainable investments (“Number of identified cases of severe human rights issues and incidents”).

# Appendix A

Application Requirements

This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S3 Affected communities. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.

Objective

AR 1. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to affected communities and, as appropriate, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.

AR 2. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the impacts on communities related to the undertaking’s operations due to extreme and sudden weather conditions.

ESRS 2 General Disclosures

Strategy

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders

AR 3. Disclosure Requirement ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of if and how it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating significant material impacts on affected communities, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.

AR 4. While affected communities may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking may disclose the views of affected communities and affected communities' representatives.

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

AR 5. Impacts on affected communities can originate in the undertaking’s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as, construction or commencement of projects with timelines that do not allow sufficient time for consultation with groups affected by the projects), its value chain (for example, land-use in countries in which ownership is often contested or records are unreliable or in which land-users such as indigenous peoples are unrecognised), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as, aggressive strategies to minimise taxation, particularly with respect to operations in developing countries).

AR 6. Impacts on affected communities that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, where the undertaking’s strategy involves moving into higher risk geographies in pursuit of certain commodities, and if affected communities resist its presence or object to its local practices, this may create extensive and costly delays, and affect the undertaking’s ability to secure future land concessions or permits. Similarly, if the undertaking’s business model relies on intensive water extraction at its plants, to the extent that it affects access to water for communities’ consumption, hygiene and livelihoods, this may result in reputationally-damaging boycotts, complaints and lawsuits.
---
# AR 7

Examples of particular characteristics of affected communities that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 10 may be an affected community that is physically or economically isolated and is particularly susceptible to introduced diseases or has limited access to social services and therefore relies on infrastructure set up by the undertaking. It may be because where land worked by women is purchased by the undertaking and payments go to male heads of households, women become further disenfranchised in the community. It may also be because the community is indigenous, and its members seek to exercise cultural or economic rights to the land owned or used by the undertaking – or by one of the entities with which it has a business relationship – in a context where their rights are not protected by the state. In addition, the undertaking shall consider whether different characteristics overlap. For example, characteristics such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, migrant status and gender may create overlapping risks of harm for certain affected communities, or for distinct parts of those affected communities, since affected communities are often heterogeneous in nature.

# AR 8

With regard to paragraph 11, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on affected communities where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a natural disaster leads to a catastrophic industrial accident involving the undertaking’s operations, resulting in severe harm to affected communities.

# Impact, risk and opportunity management

# Disclosure Requirement S3-1 – Policies related to affected communities

# AR 9

The description shall include the key information necessary to ensure a faithful representation of the policies in relation to affected communities and, therefore, the undertaking shall consider explanations of significant changes to the policies adopted during the reporting year (for example, new or additional approaches to engagement, due diligence and remedy).

# AR 10

When disclosing the alignment of its policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the undertaking shall consider that the Guiding Principles refer to the International Bill of Rights, which consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants that implement it, as well as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the International Labour Organisation’s Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (ILO No. 169) and the core conventions that underpin it, and may disclose its alignment with these instruments.

# AR 11

The undertaking may provide an illustration of the types of communication of its policies to those individuals, group of individuals or entities for whom they are relevant, either because they are expected to implement them (for example, the undertaking’s employees, contractors and suppliers), or because they have a direct interest in their implementation (for example, own workers, investors). It may disclose communication tools and channels (for example, flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face interactions, workers’ representatives), aimed at ensuring that the policy is accessible and that different audiences understand its implications. The undertaking may also explain how it identifies and removes potential barriers for dissemination, such as through translation into relevant languages or the use of graphic depictions.

# AR 12

When disclosing severe human rights issues and incidents connected to affected communities, the undertaking shall consider any legal disputes related to land rights and to the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.

# Disclosure Requirement S3-2 – Processes for engaging with affected communities about impacts

# AR 13

Explanations of how the undertaking takes into account and ensures respect of the right of indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent may include information about processes to consult with indigenous peoples to obtain such consent. The undertaking shall consider how the consultation includes a good faith negotiation with affected indigenous peoples to obtain their free, prior and informed consent where the undertaking affects the lands, territories or resources that indigenous peoples customarily own, occupy or otherwise use; or relocates them from land or territories subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; or affects or exploits their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property.
---
# AR 14

When describing which function or role has operational responsibility for such engagement and/or ultimate accountability, the undertaking may disclose whether this is a dedicated role or function or part of a broader role or function, and whether any capacity building activities have been offered to support the staff to undertake engagement. If it cannot identify such a position or function, it may state that this is the case. This disclosure could also be fulfilled by making reference to information disclosed according to ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies.

# AR 15

When preparing the disclosures described in paragraph 20 b) and c), the following illustrations may be considered:

- (a) examples of stages at which engagement occurs are i) determining the approach to mitigation and ii) evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation;
- (b) for type of engagement, these could be participation, consultation and/or information;
- (c) for the frequency of the engagement, information may be provided on whether engagement occurs on a regular basis, at certain points in a project or business process; and
- (d) for the role with operational responsibility, whether the undertaking requires relevant staff to have certain skills, or whether it provides training or capacity building to relevant staff to undertake engagement. In the case of material impacts, risks and opportunities related to indigenous peoples, this includes training on indigenous people’s rights, including on free, prior and informed consent.

# AR 16

To illustrate how the perspectives of communities have informed specific decisions or activities of the undertaking, the undertaking may provide examples from the current reporting period.

# Disclosure Requirement S3-3 – Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for affected communities to raise concerns

# AR 17

In fulfilling the requirements set out by Disclosure Requirement ESRS S3-3, the undertaking may be guided by the content of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises focused on remediation and grievance mechanisms.

# AR 18

Channels for raising concerns or needs, include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, dialogue processes or other means through which affected communities or their legitimate representatives can raise concerns about impacts or explain needs that they would like the undertaking to address. This could include channels provided by the undertaking directly, in addition to any other mechanisms the undertaking may use to gain insight into the management of impacts on communities, such as compliance audits. Where the undertaking is relying solely on information about the existence of such channels provided by its business relationships to answer this requirement, it may state that.

# AR 19

To provide greater insight into the information covered in ESRS S3-3, the undertaking may explain whether and how communities that may be affected are able to access channels at the level of the undertaking they are affected by, in relation to each material impact. Relevant insights include information on whether affected communities can access channels in a language they understand, and whether they have been consulted in the design of such channels.

# AR 20

Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other collaborative initiatives. The undertaking may disclose whether these are accessible to all affected communities who may be potentially or actually materially impacted by the undertaking, or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 227/284
---
# AR 21

In relation to the protection of individuals that use the mechanisms against retaliation, the undertaking may describe whether it treats grievances confidentially and with respect to the rights of privacy and data protection; and whether to the mechanisms can be used anonymously (for example, through representation by a third party).

# AR 22

When disclosing processes related to providing and enabling remedy for indigenous peoples, relevant information includes whether and how the undertaking has considered their customs, traditions, rules and legal systems.

# AR 23

In disclosing whether and how the undertaking knows that affected communities are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of affected communities themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of community members that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes.

# AR 24

In describing the effectiveness of channels for affected communities to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in particular Principle 31. The below considerations may be applied on an individual channel basis or for the collective system of channels:

(a) do pe channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for peir fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?
(b) are pe channels known and accessible to stakeholders?
(c) do pe channels have clear and known procedures, set timeframes and clarity on pe processes?
(d) do pe channels ensure reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise?
(e) do pe channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information bop to complainants and, where applicable, to meet any public interest at stake?
(f) do pe outcomes achieved prough pe channels accord wip internationally recognised human rights?
(g) does pe undertaking identify insights from pe channels pat support continuous learning in bop improving pe channels and preventing future impacts?
(h) does pe undertaking focus on dialogue wip complainants as pe means to reach agreed solutions, raper pan seeking to unilaterally determine pe outcome?

# Disclosure Requirement S3-4 – Taking action on material impacts on affected communities, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to affected communities, and effectiveness of those actions

# AR 25

It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice. Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:

(a) its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;
(b) its social investment or oper development programmes aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;
(c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during pe reporting period; and
(d) its aims for continued improvement.

# AR 26

Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.
---
# AR 27

Given that material negative impacts affecting communities that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage in its business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on the rights of indigenous peoples to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at minimising security-related impacts on communities or participating in company-community partnerships).

# AR 28

Impacts on communities may stem from environmental matters which are disclosed by the undertaking under the ESRS E1 to E5. Examples include:

|(a) ESRS E1 Climate Change:|The implementation of climate change mitigation plans may require the undertaking to invest in renewable energy projects that may affect the lands, territories and natural resources of indigenous peoples. If the undertaking does not consult with the affected indigenous peoples, it could negatively impact the affected communities’ right to free, prior and informed consent;|
|---|---|
|(b) ESRS E2 Pollution:|The undertaking may negatively impact affected communities by failing to protect them from pollution from a particular production facility that causes them health-related issues;|
|(c) ESRS E3 Water and marine sources:|The undertaking may negatively impact the access to clean drinking water of communities when withdrawing water in water stressed areas;|
|(d) ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems:|The undertaking may negatively affect the livelihood of local farmers through operations that contaminate soil. Additional examples include the sealing of land through building new infrastructure, which can eradicate plant species that are critical for, for example, local biodiversity or to filter water for communities; or the introduction of invasive species (whether plants or animals) that can impact ecosystems and cause subsequent harm;|
|(e) ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy:|The undertaking may negatively impact the lives of communities by affecting their health through the mismanagement of hazardous waste.|

# AR 29

Where the connection between environmental impacts and local communities is addressed in the disclosures within the Disclosure Requirements ESRS E1-E5, the undertaking may cross-reference to those and clearly identify such disclosures.

# AR 30

When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S3-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.

# AR 31

When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on affected communities in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.

# AR 32

Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.

# AR 33

Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by an undertaking and the effective management of impacts.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj

229/284
---
# AR 34

With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities that are based on affected communities’ needs, and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) information about whether and how affected communities and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these investments or programmes; and
- (b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for affected communities of these investments or programmes.
- (c) an explanation of the approximate scope of affected communities covered by the described social investment or development programmes, and, where applicable, the rationale for why selected communities were chosen for a given social investment or development programme's implementation.

# AR 35

The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 5 to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” the undertaking may be taking thoughtful measures to include women in the consultation process with an affected community to meet standards of effective stakeholder engagement, which can help empower the women in the process itself, but potentially also in their daily lives.

# AR 36

When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for affected communities a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of women community members have been provided with training on how to become local suppliers to the undertaking) from evidence of actual outcomes for affected communities (for example, that x women community members have set up small businesses and have had their contracts with the undertaking renewed year-on-year).

# AR 37

When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may for example consider programmes that aim to improve local infrastructure surrounding an undertaking’s operations, such as improvements in roads leading to a reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents involving community members.

# AR 38

When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on affected communities, the undertaking may consider the following:

- (a) risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on affected communities may include the reputational or legal exposure, as well as operational risks, where affected communities protest against resettlements or the loss of access to lands, leading to costly delays, boycotts, or lawsuits;
- (b) risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities may include disruption of business operations where indigenous peoples decide to withdraw their consent to a project on their lands, forcing the undertaking to significantly modify or abandon the project;
- (c) business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on affected communities may include more easily financing projects and being a partner of choice for communities, governments and other businesses; and
- (d) opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities may include the development of positive relationships between the undertaking and indigenous peoples that enable existing projects to expand with strong support.

# AR 39

In disclosing the information in AR 41, the undertaking may consider explanations of risks and opportunities stemming from environmental impacts or dependencies (please refer to AR 31 for further details), including related human rights (or social) impacts. Examples include reputational risks stemming from the impact on the health of communities of unmanaged polluting discharges; or the financial effects of protests that may disrupt or interrupt an undertaking’s activities, for example, in response to operations in water stressed areas that may impact the lives of affected communities.
---
# AR 40

When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.

# AR 41

When disclosing policies, action and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, actions and resources and targets in relation to that impact.

# AR 42

The undertaking shall consider whether and how its processes to manage material risks related to affected communities are integrated into its existing risk management processes.

# AR 43

When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.

# Metrics and targets

Disclosure Requirement S3-5 – Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks and opportunities

# AR 44

When disclosing information about targets in accordance with paragraph 38, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of affected communities, being as specific as possible;
- (b) the stability of the targets over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability over time;
- (c) the standards or commitments which the targets are based on (for instance codes of conduct, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).

# AR 45

Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets related to material impacts. For example, a target to fully restore livelihoods of affected communities following resettlement could both reduce impacts on those communities and reduce associated risks such as community protests.

# AR 46

The undertaking may also distinguish between short-, medium- and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have as a main objective to employ community members at a local mining site, with the long-term goal of staffing 100% locally by 2025, and with the short-term objective of adding x percent of local employees every year up and until 2025.

# AR 47

When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by linking it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.

# Objective

The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on consumers and end-users connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including:

- (a) how the undertaking affects the consumers and/or end-users of its products and/or services (referred to in this Standard as “consumers and end-users”), in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
- (b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
- (c) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on consumers and end-users, and how the undertaking manages such risks and opportunities; and
- (d) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on consumers and/or end-users.

In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on the consumers and/or end-users related to its products and/or services in relation to:

- (a) information-related impacts on consumers and/or end-users (for example, privacy, freedom of expression and access to (quality) information;
- (b) personal safety of consumers and/or end-users (for example, health and safety, security of a person and protection of children);
- (c) social inclusion of consumers and/or end-users (for example, non-discrimination, access to products and services and responsible marketing practices).

This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative impacts on the reputation of the undertaking’s products and/or services can be detrimental to its business performance, while trust in products and/or services can bring business benefits, such as increased sales or widening of the future consumer base.

The unlawful use or misuse of the undertaking’s products and services by consumers and end-users fall outside the scope of this standard.

# Interaction with other ESRS

This standard applies when material impacts on and/or material risks and opportunities related to consumers and/or end-users have been identified through the materiality assessment process laid out in ESRS 2 General disclosures.

This Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements, and ESRS 2, as well as ESRS S1 Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain and ESRS S3 Affected communities.

# Appendix A

# Application Requirements

This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users. It supports the application of the requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.

Objective

AR 1. The undertaking may highlight special issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of consumers and/or end-users in relation to contamination of a product or severe breach of privacy due to a massive data leak.

AR 2. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to consumers and/or end-users and, subsequently, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.

ESRS 2 General disclosures

Strategy

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders

AR 3. ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of if and how it considers whether its strategy and business model play a role in creating, exacerbating or (conversely) mitigating significant material impacts on consumers and/or end-users, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.

AR 4. While consumers and/or end-users may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking may disclose the views of the (actual or potential) materially affected consumers and/or end-users’ legitimate representatives or those of credible proxies that have insight into their situation.

Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model

AR 5. Impacts on consumers and/or end-users can originate in the undertaking’s business model or strategy in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (for example, providing online platforms with potential for online and offline harm), its value chain (for example, speed in developing products or services, or delivering projects, with risks to health and safety), or its cost structure and the revenue model (for example, sales-maximising incentives that put consumers at risk).

AR 6. Impacts on consumers and/or end-users that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, if the undertaking’s business model is premised on incentivising its sales force to sell high volumes of a product or service (for example, credit cards or pain medicine) at speed, and this results in large-scale harm to consumers, the undertaking may face lawsuits and reputational damage affecting its future business and credibility.

AR 7. Examples of particular characteristics of consumers and/or end-users that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 11 include young consumers and/or end-users who may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or who lack financial literacy and may be more susceptible to exploitative sales or marketing practices. They may also include women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in their access to particular services or in the marketing of particular products.
---
# AR 8

With regard to paragraph 12, the risks could arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on consumers and/or end-users where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects, for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe impacts on certain consumers’ livelihoods resulting in major changes in patterns of consumption.

# Impact, risk and opportunity management

# Disclosure Requirement S4-1 – Policies related to consumers and end-users

# AR 9

The description shall include the key information necessary to ensure a faithful representation of the policies in relation to consumers and end-users, and therefore, the undertaking shall consider explanations of significant changes to the policies adopted during the reporting year (for example, new expectations for business customers, new or additional approaches to due diligence and remedy).

# AR 10

The policy may take the form of a stand-alone policy regarding consumers and/or end-users or be included in a broader document such as a code of ethics or a general sustainability policy that has already been disclosed by the undertaking as part of another ESRS. In those cases, the undertaking shall provide an accurate cross-reference to identify the aspects of the policy that satisfy the requirements of this Disclosure Requirement.

# AR 11

In disclosing its alignment of its policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the undertaking shall consider that the Guiding Principles refer to the International Bill of Human Rights, which consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants that implement it, and may disclose its alignment with these instruments.

# AR 12

When disclosing how external facing policies are embedded, the undertaking may, for example, consider internal-facing sales and distribution policies and alignment with other policies relevant to consumers and/or end-users. The undertaking shall also consider its policies for safeguarding the veracity and usefulness of information provided to potential and actual consumers and/or end-users, both before and after sale.

# AR 13

The undertaking may provide an illustration of the types of communication of its policies to those individuals, group of individuals or entities for whom they are relevant, either because they are expected to implement them (for example, the undertaking’s employees, contractors and suppliers), or because they have a direct interest in their implementation (for example, own workers, investors). It may disclose communication tools and channels (for example, flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face interactions, workers’ representatives), aimed at ensuring that the policy is accessible and that different audiences understand its implications. The undertaking may also explain how it identifies and removes potential barriers for dissemination, such as through translation into relevant languages or the use of graphic depictions.

# Disclosure Requirement S4-2 – Processes for engaging with consumers and end-users about impacts

# AR 14

Credible proxies who have knowledge of the interests, experiences or perspectives of consumers and end-users could include national consumer protection bodies for some consumers.

# AR 15

When describing which function or role has operational responsibility for such engagement and/or ultimate accountability, the undertaking may disclose whether this is a dedicated role or function or part of a broader role or function, and whether any capacity building activities have been offered to support the staff to undertake engagement. If it cannot identify such a position or function, it may state that this is the case. This disclosure could also be fulfilled by making reference to information disclosed according to ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 241/284
---
# AR 16.

When preparing the disclosures described in paragraph 20 b) and c), the following illustrations may be considered:

(a) for stage(s) at which engagement occurs, examples could be in determining mitigation approaches or in evaluating peir effectiveness;
(b) for type of engagement, pese could be participation, consultation and/or information;
(c) for pe frequency of pe engagement, information may be provided on wheper engagement occurs on a regular basis, at certain points in a project or business process, as well as wheper it occurs in response to legal requirements and/or in response to stakeholder requests and wheper pe result of pe engagement is being integrated into pe undertaking's decision-making processes; and
(d) for pe role wip operational responsibility, wheper pe undertaking requires relevant staff to have certain skills, or wheper it provides training or capacity building to relevant staff to undertake engagement.

# AR 17.

To illustrate how the perspectives of consumers and/or end-users have informed specific decisions or activities of the undertaking, the undertaking may provide examples from the current reporting period.

# Disclosure Requirement S4-3 – Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for consumers and end-users to raise concerns

# AR 18.

In fulfilling the requirements set out by the disclosure criteria of ESRS S4-3, the undertaking may be guided by the content of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises focused on remediation and grievance mechanisms.

# AR 19.

Channels for raising concerns or needs, include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, dialogue processes or other means through which consumers and/or end-users or their legitimate representatives can raise concerns about impacts or explain needs that they would like the undertaking to address. This could include channels provided by the undertaking directly and is to be disclosed in addition to any other mechanisms the undertaking may use to gain insight into the management of impacts on consumers and/or end-users, such as compliance audits. Where the undertaking is relying solely on information about the existence of such channels provided by its business relationships to answer this requirement, it may state that.

# AR 20.

To provide greater insight into the information covered in ESRS S4-3, the undertaking may provide insight into whether and how consumers and/or end-users that may be affected are able to access channels at the level of the undertaking they are affected by, in relation to each material impact.

# AR 21.

Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other collaborative initiatives. With regard to the scope of these mechanisms, the undertaking may disclose whether these are accessible to all consumers and/or end-users who may be potentially or actually materially impacted by the undertaking, or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts, and through which consumers and/or end-users (or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts), can raise complaints or concerns related to the undertaking’s own activities.

# AR 22.

In relation to the protection of individuals that use the mechanisms against the retaliation, the undertaking may describe whether it treats grievances confidentially and with respect to the rights of privacy and data protection; and whether they allow for consumer and/or end-users to use them anonymously (for example, through representation by a third party).

# AR 23.

In disclosing whether and how the undertaking knows that consumers and/or end-users are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of consumers and/or end-users themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of
---
consumers and/or end-users that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes. To illustrate the usage level of such channels, the undertaking may disclose the number of complaints received from consumers and/or end-users during the reporting period.

AR 24. In describing the effectiveness of channels for consumers and/or end-users to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for nonjudicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The below considerations may be applied on an individual channel basis or for the collective system of channels:

- (a) do the channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?
- (b) are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?
- (c) do the channels have known procedures, set timeframes and clarity on the processes?
- (d) do the channels ensure reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise?
- (e) do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and where applicable, to meet any public interest at stake?
- (f) do the outcomes achieved from the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?
- (g) does the undertaking identify insights from the channels that support continuous learning in both improving the channels and preventing future impacts?
- (h) does the undertaking focus on dialogue with complainants as the means to reach agreed solutions, rather than seeking to unilaterally determine the outcome?

For more information, see Principle 31 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Disclosure Requirement S4-4 – Taking action on material impacts on consumers and end-users, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to consumers and end-users, and effectiveness of those actions

AR 25. It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its downstream value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice). Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:

- (a) Its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;
- (b) its initiatives aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;
- (c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and
- (d) its aims for continued improvement.

AR 26. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.

AR 27. Given that material negative impacts affecting consumers and/or end-users that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use leverage with relevant business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on proper product use or sale practices to business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible marketing or product safety).

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj
---
# AR 28

When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S4-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.

# AR 29

When disclosing whether and how it considers actual and potential impacts on consumers and/or end-users in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.

# AR 30

In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of actions to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.

# AR 31

Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.

# AR 32

Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by the undertaking and the effective management of impacts.

# AR 33

With regard to initiatives or processes the undertaking has in place that are based on affected consumers and/or end-users’ needs and their level of implementation, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) information about whether and how consumers and/or end-users and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these programmes or processes;
- (b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for consumers and/or end-users of these programmes or processes.

# AR 34

The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for consumers and/or end-users are designed to also support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 3 to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” the undertaking may be actively working to make its products less addictive and harmful to physical and psychological health.

# AR 35

When disclosing the intended positive outcomes of its actions for consumers and/or end-users a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of consumers have received information about healthy eating habits) from evidence of actual outcomes for consumers and/or end-users (for example, that x number of consumers have adopted healthier eating habits).

# AR 36

When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may, for example, consider programmes that aim to support heightened awareness of the risk of online scams, leading to a reduction in the number of cases of end-users experiencing breaches of data privacy.

# AR 37

When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on consumers and/or end-users, the undertaking may consider the following:

- (a) risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on consumers and/or end-users may include reputational or legal exposure where poorly designed or defective products result in injuries or deaths;
- (b) risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users may include the loss of business continuity where an economic crisis makes consumers unable to afford certain products or services;
---
# Metrics and targets

Disclosure Requirement S4-5 – Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks and opportunities

AR 42. When disclosing targets in relation to consumers and/or end-users, the undertaking may disclose:

- (a) the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of consumers and/or end-users, being as specific as possible;
- (b) their stability over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability; and/or
- (c) references standards or commitments on which the targets are based are to be clearly defined in the reporting (for instance codes of conduct, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).

AR 43. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to material impacts. For example, a target to ensure equal access to finance for underserved consumers could both reduce discrimination impacts on those consumers and enlarge the undertaking’s pool of customers.

AR 44. The undertaking may also distinguish between short, medium and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have as a main objective to make its online services accessible to people with disabilities, with the long-term goal of having adapted 100% of its online services by 2025, and with the short-term objective of adding x number of accessible features every year up and until 2025.

AR 45. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.

- i. "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;
---
# ii. "available techniques"

means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator; and

# iii. "best"

means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.

# Biodiversity loss

The reduction of any aspect of biological diversity (i.e., diversity at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels) in a particular area through death (including extinction), destruction or physical manual removal; it can refer to many scales, from global extinctions to population extinctions, resulting in decreased total diversity at the same scale.

# Biodiversity or biological diversity

The variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part. This includes variation in genetic, phenotypic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes, as well as changes in abundance and distribution over time and space within and among species, biological communities and ecosystems.

# Business model

The undertaking’s system of transforming inputs through its activities into outputs and outcomes that aims to fulfil the undertaking’s strategic purposes and create value over the short-, medium- and long-term. ESRS use the term “business model” in the singular, although it is recognised that undertakings may have more than one business model.

# Business relationships

The relationships the undertaking has with business partners, entities in its value chain, and any other non-State or State entity directly linked to its business operations, products or services. Business relationships are not limited to direct contractual relationships. They include indirect business relationships in the undertaking’s value chain beyond the first tier, and shareholding positions in joint ventures or investments.

# By-product

A substance or object resulting from a production process the primary aim of which is not the production of that substance or object is considered not to be waste, but to be a by-product if the following conditions are met:
1. further use of the substance or object is certain;
2. the substance or object can be used directly without any further processing other than normal industrial practice;
3. the substance or object is produced as an integral part of a production process; and
4. further use is lawful, i.e., the substance or object fulfils all relevant product, environmental and health protection requirements for the specific use and will not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts.

# Carbon credit

# Carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (eq)

The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential (GWP) of each greenhouse gas, expressed in terms of the GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to evaluate releasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse gases on a common basis.

# Child labour

Work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. It refers to work that:
1. is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children; and/or
2. interferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school; obliging them to leave school prematurely; or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.

A child is defined as a person under the age of 18. Whether or not particular forms of ‘work’ can be called ‘child labour’ depends on the child’s age, the type and hours of work performed and the conditions under which it is performed. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.
The minimum age of work should not be less than the minimum age of completion of compulsory schooling, and, in any case, should not be less than 15 years according to International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 138 on Minimum Age. Exceptions can occur in certain countries where economies and educational facilities are insufficiently developed, and a minimum age of 14 years applies.
---
# These countries of exception are specified by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in response to a special application by the country concerned and in consultation with representative organisations of employers and workers.

National laws may permit the employment of persons 13 to 15 years of age in light work as long as it is not likely to be harmful to their health or development and does not prejudice their attendance at school or participation in vocational or training programmes. The minimum age for admission into work which by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out is likely to jeopardise the health, safety or morals of young persons shall not be less than 18 years.

# Circular economy

An economic system in which the value of products, materials and other resources in the economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimizing waste and the release of hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle, including through the application of the waste hierarchy.

# Circular economy principles

- usability;
- reusability;
- repairability;
- disassembly;
- remanufacturing or refurbishment;
- recycling;
- recirculation by the biological cycle;
- other potential optimization of product and material use.

# Circular material use rate

Recirculation of materials, components and products in practice after first use employing the following strategies (in order of preference):

1. maintenance/prolonged use;
2. reuse/redistribution;
3. refurbishment/remanufacturing;
4. recycling, composting, or anaerobic digestion.

The use rate is defined as the ratio of circular use of materials to overall use of materials.

A determination as substantiated by a court of law is not required.

# Consumer

Individuals who acquire, consume or use goods and services for personal use, eiper for pemselves or for opers, and not for resale, commercial or trade, business, craft or profession purposes.

# Corporate culture

# Discrimination

Discrimination can occur directly or indirectly. Direct discrimination occurs when an individual is treated less favourably by comparison to how others, who are in a similar situation, have been or would be treated, and the reason for this is a particular characteristic they hold, which falls under a ‘protected ground’. Indirect discrimination occurs when an apparently neutral rule disadvantages a person or a group sharing the same characteristics. It must be shown that a group is disadvantaged by a decision when compared to a comparator group.

# Double materiality

Double materiality has two dimensions: impact materiality and financial materiality. A sustainability matter meets the criterion of double materiality if it is material from the impact perspective or the financial perspective or both.

# Durability of a product, component or material

The ability of a product, component or material to remain functional and relevant when used as intended.

# Ecosystem services

The contributions of ecosystems to the benefits that are used in economic and other human activity, respectively the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem services can be divided into supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural. The Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) classifies types of ecosystems services.

# Ecosystem(s)

A dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit. A typology of ecosystems is provided by the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology 2.0.

Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (IED).
---
# Equal treatment

The principle of equal treatment is a general principle of European law which presupposes that comparable situations or parties in comparable situations are treated in the same way. In the context of ESRS S1, the term “equal treatment” also refers to the principle of non-discrimination, according to which there shall be no direct or indirect discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.

# Financial effects

Effects from risks and opportunities that affect the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium or long term.

# Financial materiality

A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it generates risks or opportunities that affect (or could reasonably be expected to affect) the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term.

# Forced labour

All work or service which is exacted from any person under the threat of penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily. The term encompasses all situations in which persons are coerced by any means to perform work and includes both traditional ‘slave-like’ practices and contemporary forms of coercion where labor exploitation is involved, which may include human trafficking and modern slavery.

# Fossil fuel

Non-renewable carbon-based energy sources such as solid fuels, natural gas, and oil.

# Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)

A manifestation of indigenous peoples’ right to self-determine their political, social, economic, and cultural priorities. It constitutes three interrelated and cumulative rights of indigenous peoples: the right to be consulted; the right to participate; and the right to their lands, territories, and resources. FPIC pertains to indigenous peoples and is recognized under international human rights law, notably the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

# Freshwater

Groundwater and surface water, with a mean annual salinity of < 0.5 ‰ (i.e., the limit mentioned in Annex II of the Water Framework Directive).

# GHG emission reduction

Decrease in the undertaking’s Scope 1, 2, 3, or total GHG emissions at the end of the reporting period, relative to emissions in the base year. Emission reductions may result from, among others, energy efficiency, electrification, suppliers' decarbonization, electricity mix decarbonization, sustainable products development, or changes in reporting boundaries or activities (e.g., outsourcing, reduced capacities), provided they are achieved within the undertaking's own operations and upstream and downstream value chain. Removals and avoided emissions are not counted as emission reductions.

# GHG removal and storage

(Anthropogenic) removals refer to the withdrawal of GHGs from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. These include enhancing biological anthropogenic sinks of CO2 and using chemical engineering to achieve long-term removal and storage. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from industrial and energy-related sources, which alone does not remove CO2 from the atmosphere, can remove atmospheric CO2 if it is

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj
---
# Global warming potential (GWP)

A factor describing the radiative forcing impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG relative to one unit of CO2.

# Greenhouse Gases (GHG)

The gases listed in Part 2 of Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). These include Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

# Grievance mechanism

Any routinized, state-based or non-state-based, judicial or non-judicial processes through which stakeholders can raise grievances and seek remedy. Examples of state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms include courts, labour tribunals, national human rights institutions, National Contact Points under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson offices, consumer protection agencies, regulatory oversight bodies, and government-run complaints offices. Non-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered by the undertaking, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organisations, civil society organisations, or multi-stakeholder groups. Operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organisation either alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organisation’s stakeholders. They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing both harm and grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the organisation’s due diligence from those who are directly affected. According to UN Guiding Principle 31, effective grievance mechanisms are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also based on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organisation to assess the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has established itself.

# Groundwater

All water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil (14).

13 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1).

---
# Habitat

The place or type of site where an organism or population naturally occurs. Also used to mean the environmental attributes required by a particular species or its ecological niche.

# Habitat fragmentation

A general term describing the set of processes by which habitat loss results in the division of continuous habitats into a greater number of smaller patches of lesser total size and isolated from each other by a matrix of dissimilar habitats. Habitat fragmentation may occur through natural processes (e.g., forest and grassland fires, flooding) and through human activities (forestry, agriculture, urbanisation).

# Harassment

A situation where an unwanted conduct related to a protected ground of discrimination (for example, gender under Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation under Council Directive 2000/78/EC) occurs with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.

# Hazardous waste

# High climate impact sectors

Sectors that are listed in Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288).

# Impacts

The effect the undertaking has or could have on the environment and people, including effects on their human rights, connected with its own operations and upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products and services, as well as through its business relationships. The impacts can be actual or potential, negative or positive, intended or unintended, and reversible or irreversible. They can arise over the short-, medium-, or long-term. Impacts indicate the undertaking’s contribution, negative or positive, to sustainable development.

# Impact drivers

All the factors that cause changes in nature, anthropogenic assets, nature’s contributions to people and a good quality of life. Direct drivers of change can be both natural and anthropogenic. They have direct physical (mechanical, chemical, noise, light etc.) and behaviour-affecting impacts on nature. They include, inter alia, climate change, pollution, different types of land use change, invasive alien species and zoonoses, and exploitation.

# Indirect impact drivers

Indirect impact drivers operate diffusely by altering and influencing direct drivers (by affecting their level, direction or rate) as well as other indirect drivers. Interactions between indirect and direct drivers create different chains of relationship, attribution, and impacts, which may vary according to type, intensity, duration, and distance. These relationships can also lead to different types of spill-over effects. Global indirect drivers include economic, demographic, governance, technological and cultural ones. Special attention is given, among indirect drivers, to the role of institutions (both formal and informal) and impacts of the patterns of production, supply and consumption on nature, nature’s contributions to people and good quality of life.

# Impact materiality

A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when it pertains to the undertaking’s material actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on people or the environment over the short-, medium- and long-term. A material sustainability matter from an impact perspective includes impacts connected with the undertaking’s own operations and upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products and services, as well as through its business relationships.

# Incident

A legal action or complaint registered with the undertaking or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of non-compliance identified by the undertaking through established procedures. Established procedures to identify instances of non-compliance can include management system audits, formal monitoring programs, or grievance mechanisms.

# Incineration

The controlled burning of waste at high temperature with or without energy recovery.

# Independent board member

Board members that exercise independent judgment free from any external influence or conflicts of interest. Independence generally means the exercise of objective, unfettered judgement. When used as the measure by which to judge the appearance of independence, or to categorise a non-executive member of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies or their committees as independent, it means the absence of an interest, position, association or relationship which, when judged from the perspective of a reasonable and informed third party, is likely to influence unduly or cause bias in decision-making.

# Indigenous peoples

There is no single definition for indigenous peoples agreed on at the international level. In practice, there is convergence among international agencies on what groups can be considered indigenous peoples and should enjoy special protection as such. An important criteria for defining indigenous people is related to their connection to a traditional area, as defined in ILO Convention No. 169, Article 1, which states that the convention applies to: “(a) tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations; (b) peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions”. ILO Convention 169 also states in Article 1(2) that: “[s]elf-identification as indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the provisions of this Convention apply”.

Indirect GHG emissions: GHG emissions that are a consequence of the activities of an entity but occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity. Indirect emissions are Scope 2 GHG emissions and scope 3 GHG emissions combined.

Installation: A stationary technical unit within which one or more activities are carried out which could have an effect on emissions and pollution.

Internal carbon price: Price used by an undertaking to assess the financial implications of changes to investment, production, and consumption patterns, and of potential technological progress and future emissions abatement costs.

Internal carbon pricing scheme: An organisational arrangement that allows an undertaking to apply carbon prices in strategic and operational decision making. There are two types of internal carbon prices commonly used by undertakings. The first type is a shadow price, which is a theoretical cost or notional amount that the undertaking does not charge but that can be used in assessing the economic implications or trade-offs for such things as risk impacts, new investments, net present value of projects, and the cost-benefit of various initiatives. The second type is an internal tax or fee, which is a carbon price charged to a business activity, product line, or other business unit based on its GHG emissions (these internal taxes or fees are similar to intracompany transfer pricing).

Invasive or alien species: Species whose introduction and/or spread by human action outside their natural distribution threatens biological diversity, food security, and human health and well-being. "Alien" refers to the species having been introduced outside its natural distribution ("exotic", "non-native" and "non-indigenous" are synonyms for "alien"). "Invasive" means "tending to expand into and modify ecosystems to which it has been introduced". Thus, a species may be alien without being invasive, or, in the case of a species native to a region, it may increase and become invasive, without actually being an alien species.

Key Biodiversity Area (KBA): Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Sites qualify as global KBAs if they meet one or more of 11 criteria, clustered into five categories: threatened biodiversity; geographically restricted biodiversity; ecological integrity; biological processes; and, irreplaceability. The World Database of KBAs is managed by BirdLife International on behalf of the KBA Partnership.

Land degradation: The many processes that drive the decline or loss in biodiversity, ecosystem functions or their benefits to people and includes the degradation of all terrestrial ecosystems.

Landfill: A waste disposal site for the deposit of the waste onto or into land.

Land-system (change): The terrestrial component of the Earth system, encompassing all processes and activities related to the human use of land. These include socio-economic, technological and organisational inputs and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities. The land-systems concept

Article 2 point (g) of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (OJ L 182, 16.7.1999, p. 1).

# Metrics

Qualitative and quantitative indicators that the undertaking uses to measure and report on the effectiveness of the delivery of its sustainability-related policies and against its targets over time. Metrics also support the measurement of the undertaking’s results in respect of affected people, the environment, and the undertaking.

# Microplastics

Small pieces of plastics, usually smaller than 5mm. A growing volume of microplastics is found in the environment, including the sea, and in food and drinking water. Once in the environment, microplastics do not biodegrade and tend to accumulate, unless they are specifically designed to biodegrade in the open environment. Biodegradability is a complex phenomenon, especially in the marine environment. There are increasing concerns about the presence of microplastics in different environment compartments (such as water), their impact on the environment, and potentially human health.

# Minimum Disclosure Requirement

A minimum disclosure requirement sets the required content of the information that the undertaking includes when it reports on policies, actions, metrics, or targets, either pursuant to a Disclosure Requirement in an ESRS or on an entity-specific basis.

# Natural resources

Natural assets (raw materials) occurring in nature that can be used for economic production or consumption.

# Nature-based solutions

Actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems which address social, economic, and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services, resilience, and biodiversity benefits.

# Net-zero target

Setting a net-zero target at the level of an undertaking aligned with meeting societal climate goals means:

i. achieving a scale of value chain emissions reductions consistent with the abatement required to reach global net-zero in 1.5°C pathways; and

ii. neutralizing the impact of any residual emissions (after approximately 90-95% of GHG emission reduction with the possibility for justified sectoral variations in line with a recognized sectoral pathway) by permanently removing an equivalent volume of CO2.

# Non-employees

Non-employees in an undertaking’s own workforce include both individual contractors supplying labor to the undertaking (“self-employed people”) and people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78).

# Non-renewable energy

Energy which cannot be identified as being derived from renewable sources.

# Operational control

Operational control (over an entity, site, operation, or asset) is the situation where the undertaking has the ability to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation, or asset.

# Opportunities

Sustainability-related opportunities with positive financial effects.

# Overtime

The number of hours actually worked by a worker in excess of his or her contractual hours of work.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 273/284
---

(21)

# Pay

The ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other remuneration, whether in cash or in kind which the worker receives directly or indirectly ('complementary or variable components'), in respect of his/her employment from his/her employer. 'Pay level' means gross annual pay and the corresponding gross hourly pay. 'Median pay level' means the pay of the employee that would have half of the employees earn more and half less than they do.

# Persons with disabilities

Persons who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

# Physical risks

All global economic enterprise depends on the functioning of earth systems, such as a stable climate and on ecosystem services, such as the provision of biomass (raw materials). Nature-related physical risks are a direct result of an organisation's dependence on nature. Physical risks arise when natural systems are compromised, due to the impact of climatic events (e.g., extremes of weather such as a drought), geologic events (e.g., seismic events such as an earthquake) events or changes in ecosystem equilibria, such as soil quality or marine ecology, which affect the ecosystem services organisations depend on. These can be acute, chronic, or both. Nature-related physical risks arise as a result of changes in the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) conditions that support healthy, functioning ecosystems. Physical risks are usually location-specific. Nature-related physical risks are often associated with climate-related physical risks.

# Planetary boundaries

This concept allows to estimate a safe operating space for humanity with respect to the functioning of the Earth. The boundary level for each key Earth System process that should not be transgressed if we are to avoid unacceptable global environmental change, is quantified.

# Policy

A set or framework of general objectives and management principles that the undertaking uses for decision-making. A policy implements the undertaking's strategy or management decisions related to a material sustainability matter. Each policy is under the responsibility of defined person(s), specifies its perimeter of application, and includes one or more objectives (linked when applicable to measurable targets). A policy is validated and reviewed following the undertakings' applicable governance rules. A policy is implemented through actions or action plans.

This includes upstream entities with which the undertaking has a direct relationship (often referred to as a first-tier supplier) and entities with which the undertaking has an indirect business relationship.

# Surface water

Inland waters, except groundwater; transitional waters and coastal waters, except in respect of chemical status for which it shall also include territorial waters.

# Sustainability matters

Environmental, social and human rights, and governance factors, including sustainability factors defined in Article 2, point (24), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

# Sustainability statement

The dedicated section of the undertaking’s management report where the information about sustainability matters prepared in compliance with Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and the ESRS is presented.

# Sustainability-related opportunities

Uncertain environmental, social or governance events or conditions that, if they occur, could cause a potential material positive effect on the undertaking's business model, or strategy on its capability to achieve its goals and targets and to create value, and therefore may influence its decisions and those of its business relationship partners with regard to sustainability matters. Like any other opportunity, sustainability-related opportunities are measured as a combination of an impact’s magnitude and the probability of occurrence.

# Sustainability-related risks

Uncertain environmental, social or governance events or conditions that, if they occur, could cause a potential material negative effect on the undertaking's business model or strategy and on its capability to achieve its goals and targets and to create value, and therefore may influence its decisions and those of its business relationships with regard to sustainability matters. Like any other risks, sustainability-related risks are the combination of an impact’s magnitude and the probability of occurrence.

# Sustainability-related impacts

The effect the undertaking has or could have on the environment and people, including effects on their human rights, as a result of the undertaking's activities or business relationships. The impacts can be actual or potential, negative or positive, short-term, medium or long-term, intended or unintended, and reversible or irreversible. Impacts indicate the undertaking's contribution, negative or positive, to sustainable development.

# Systemic risks

Risks arising from the breakdown of the entire system, rather than the failure of individual parts. They are characterised by modest tipping points combining indirectly to produce large failures with cascading of interactions of physical and transition risks (contagion), as one loss triggers a chain of others, and with systems unable to recover equilibrium after a shock. An example is the loss of a keystone species, such as sea otters, which have a critical role in ecosystem community structure. When sea otters were hunted to near extinction in the 1900s, the coastal ecosystems flipped and biomass production was greatly reduced.

# Targets

Measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound goals that the undertaking aims to achieve in relation to material impacts, risks or opportunities. They may be set voluntarily by the undertaking or derive from legal requirements on the undertaking.

# Threatened species

Endangered species, including flora and fauna, listed in the European Red List or the IUCN Red List, as referred to in Section 7 of Annex II to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.

# Training

Initiatives put in place by the undertaking aimed at the maintenance and/or improvement of skills and knowledge of its own workers. It can include different methodologies, such as on-site training, and online training.

# Transition plan

A specific type of action plan that is adopted by the undertaking in relation to a strategic decision and that addresses:

- i. a public policy objective; and/or
- ii. an entity-specific action plan organised as a structured set of targets and actions, associated with a key strategic decision, a major change in business model, and/or particularly important actions and allocated resources.

# Transition plan for climate change mitigation

An aspect of an undertaking’s overall strategy that lays out the undertaking’s targets, actions and resources for its transition towards a lower–carbon economy, including actions such as reducing its GHG emissions with regard to the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and climate neutrality.

# Transition risks

Risks that result from a misalignment between an organisation’s or investor’s strategy and management and the changing regulatory, policy or societal landscape in which it operates. Developments aimed at halting or reversing damage to the climate or to nature, such as government measures, technological breakthroughs, market changes, litigation and changing consumer preferences can all create or change transition risks.

# Users

Users of sustainability statements are primary users of general-purpose financial reporting (existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors including asset managers, credit institutions, insurance undertakings), as well as other users, including the undertaking’s business partners, trade unions and social partners, civil society and non-governmental organisations, governments, analysts and academics.

# Value chain

The full range of activities, resources and relationships related to the undertaking’s business model and the external environment in which it operates.
---
# Value Chain

A value chain encompasses the activities, resources and relationships the undertaking uses and relies on to create its products or services from conception to delivery, consumption and end-of-life. Relevant activities, resources and relationships include:

- those in the undertaking’s own operations, such as human resources;
- those along its supply, marketing and distribution channels, such as materials and service sourcing and product and service sale and delivery; and
- the financing, geographical, geopolitical and regulatory environments in which the undertaking operates.

Value chain includes actors upstream and downstream from the undertaking. Actors upstream from the undertaking (e.g., suppliers) provide products or services that are used in the development of the undertaking’s products or services. Entities downstream from the undertaking (e.g., distributors, customers) receive products or services from the undertaking.

ESRS use the term “value chain” in the singular, although it is recognised that undertakings may have multiple value chains.

# Value Chain Worker

An individual performing work in the value chain of the undertaking, regardless of the existence or nature of any contractual relationship with the undertaking. In the ESRS, the scope of workers in the value chain include all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking. This includes impacts that are connected to the undertaking’s own operations, and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. This includes all workers who are not in the scope of ‘Own Workforce’ ('Own Workforce' includes people who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking ('employees') and non-employees who are either individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking ('self-employed people') or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities. (NACE Code N78)

# Wage

Gross wage, excluding variable components such as overtime and incentive pay, and excluding allowances unless they are guaranteed.

# Waste

Any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.

# Waste Hierarchy

Priority order in waste prevention and management:

1. prevention;
2. preparing for re-use;
3. recycling;
4. other recovery (e.g., energy recovery); and
5. disposal.

# Waste Management

The collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste, including the supervision of such operations and the after-care of disposal sites, and including actions taken as a dealer or broker.

Article 3(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC on waste.

Article 4(1) of the Directive 2008/98/EC on waste.

# Wastewater

Water which is of no further immediate value to the purpose for which it was used or in the pursuit of which it was produced because of its quality, quantity, or time of occurrence. Wastewater from one user can be a potential supply to a user elsewhere. Cooling water is not considered to be wastewater.

# Water consumption

The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the undertaking (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third party over the course of the reporting period.

# Water discharge

The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the organisation and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties over the course of the reporting period.

# Water intensity

A metric providing the relationship between a volumetric aspect of water and a unit of activity (products, sales, etc.) created.

# Water (recycled and reused)

Water and wastewater (treated or untreated) that has been used more than once before being discharged from the undertaking’s or shared facilities’ boundary, so that water demand is reduced. This may be in the same process (recycled) or in a different process within the same facility (own or shared with other undertakings) or in another of the undertaking’s facilities (reused).

# Water scarcity

The volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. Scarcity is human driven, it is a function of the volume of human water consumption relative to the volume of water resources in a given area. As such, an arid region with very little water, but no human water consumption would not be considered scarce, but rather arid. Water scarcity is a physical, objective reality that can be measured consistently across regions and over time. Water scarcity reflects the physical abundance of freshwater rather than whether that water is suitable for use. For instance, a region may have abundant water resources (and thus not be considered water scarce) but have such severe pollution that those supplies are unfit for human or ecological uses.

# Water withdrawal

The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the undertaking from all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.

# Workers’ representatives

Workers' representatives means:
- trade union representatives, namely representatives designated or elected by trade unions or by members of such unions in accordance with national legislation and practice;
- duly elected representatives, namely representatives who are freely elected by the workers of the organisation, not under the domination or control of the employer in accordance with provisions of national laws or regulations or of collective agreements and whose functions do not include activities which are the exclusive prerogative of trade unions in the country concerned and which existence is not used to undermine the position of the trade unions concerned or their representatives.
---
# Work-life balance

Satisfactory state of equilibrium between an individual’s work and private life. Work-life balance in a broader sense encompasses not only the balance between work and private life given family or care responsibilities, but also time allocation between time spent at work and in private life beyond family responsibilities.

# Work-related hazards

- Physical (e.g., radiation, temperature extremes, constant loud noise, spills on floors or tripping hazards, unguarded machinery, faulty electrical equipment)
- Ergonomic (e.g., improperly adjusted workstations and chairs, awkward movements, vibration)
- Chemical (e.g., exposure to carcinogens, mutagens, reprotoxic substances, solvents, carbon monoxide, or pesticides)
- Biological (e.g., exposure to blood and bodily fluids, fungi, bacteria, viruses, or insect bites)
- Psychosocial (e.g., verbal abuse, harassment, bullying)
- Related to work-organisation (e.g., excessive workload demands, shift work, long hours, night work, workplace violence)

# Work-related incident

Occurrence arising out of or in the course of work that could or does result in injury or ill health. Incidents might be due to, for example, electrical problems, explosion, fire, overflow, overturning, leakage, flow, breakage, bursting, splitting, loss of control, slipping, stumbling and falling, body movement without stress, body movement under/with stress, shock, fright, workplace violence or harassment (e.g., sexual harassment). An incident that results in injury or ill health is often referred to as an ‘accident’. An incident that has the potential to result in injury or ill health but where none occurs is often referred to as a ‘close call’, ‘near-miss’, or ‘near-hit’.
