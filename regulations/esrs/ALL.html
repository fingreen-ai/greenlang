<p>supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards sustainability reporting standards</p>
<p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
<p>THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,</p>
<p>Having regard to Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, and in particular Article 29b(1), first subparagraph, thereof,</p>
<p>Whereas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council, requires large undertakings, small and medium-sized undertakings with securities admitted to trading on the EU regulated markets, as well as parent undertakings of large groups, to include in a dedicated section of their management report or consolidated management report the information necessary to understand the undertaking’s impacts on sustainability matters, and the information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the undertaking’s development, performance and position. Undertakings are to prepare this information in accordance with sustainability reporting standards starting from the financial year indicated in Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 for each category of undertakings.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commission is required to adopt by 30 June 2023 a first set of standards specifying the information that undertakings are to report in accordance with Article 19a(1) and (2), and Article 29a(1) and (2) of that Directive, including at least the information that financial market participants need in order to comply with the disclosure obligations of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commission has taken into account the technical advice provided by the EFRAG. EFRAG’s independent technical advice meets the criteria set out in Article 49(3b), first, second and third subparagraphs, of Directive 2013/34/EU. To ensure proportionality and to facilitate the correct application of the standards by undertakings, the Commission has introduced modifications to EFRAG’s technical advice as regards the materiality approach, the phasing-in of certain requirements, the conversion of certain requirements into voluntary datapoints, the introduction of flexibilities in a number of disclosure requirements, the introduction of technical modifications to ensure coherence with the Union’s legal framework and a high degree of interoperability with global standard-setting initiatives, as well as editorial modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>These sustainability reporting standards meet the requirements set out in Article 29b of Directive 2013/34/EU.</p></li>
<li><p>Common sustainability reporting standards should therefore be adopted.</p></li>
<li><p>In accordance with Article 29b(1), fourth subparagraph, of Directive 2013/34/EU this Regulation should not enter into force earlier than 4 months after its adoption by the Commission. Considering that Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 requires certain categories of undertakings to apply these sustainability reporting standards for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024, this Regulation should enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p></li>

<p>OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19.</p>
<p>Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (OJ L 322, 16.12.2022, p. 15).</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1).</p>

<li><p>Specifically, ESRS specify the information that an undertaking shall disclose about its material impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to environmental, social, and governance sustainability matters. ESRS do not require undertakings to disclose any information on environmental, social and governance topics covered by ESRS when the undertaking has assessed the topic in question as non-material (See Appendix E of this Standard “Flowchart for determining disclosures to be included”). The information disclosed in accordance with ESRS enables users of the sustainability statement to understand the undertaking’s material impacts on people and environment and the material effects of sustainability matters on the undertaking’s development, performance and position.</p></li>
<li><p>The objective of this Standard (ESRS 1) is to provide an understanding of the architecture of ESRS, the drafting conventions and fundamental concepts used, and the general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability information in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464.</p></li>

<p>Cross-cutting standards and topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all undertakings regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking operates in.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures apply to the sustainability matters covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.</p></li>
<li><p>This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.</p></li>
<li><p>ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level across all material sustainability matters on the reporting areas governance, strategy, impact, risk and opportunity management, and metrics and targets.</p></li>
<li><p>Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively ‘sustainability matters’) covered by topical ESRS.</p></li>

<li><p>In this context, impacts on people or the environment include impacts in relation to environmental, social and governance matters.</p></li>
<li><p>The materiality assessment of a negative impact is informed by the due diligence process defined in the international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

<h1>49. A sustainability matter is material from a financial perspective if it triggers or could reasonably be expected to trigger material financial effects on the undertaking. This is the case when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have a material influence, or could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the undertaking’s development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Risks and opportunities may derive from past events or future events. The financial materiality of a sustainability matter is not constrained to matters that are within the control of the undertaking but includes information on material risks and opportunities attributable to business relationships beyond the scope of consolidation used in the preparation of financial statements.<a class="headerlink" href="#a-sustainability-matter-is-material-from-a-financial-perspective-if-it-triggers-or-could-reasonably-be-expected-to-trigger-material-financial-effects-on-the-undertaking-this-is-the-case-when-a-sustainability-matter-generates-risks-or-opportunities-that-have-a-material-influence-or-could-reasonably-be-expected-to-have-a-material-influence-on-the-undertakings-development-financial-position-financial-performance-cash-flows-access-to-finance-or-cost-of-capital-over-the-short-medium-or-long-term-risks-and-opportunities-may-derive-from-past-events-or-future-events-the-financial-materiality-of-a-sustainability-matter-is-not-constrained-to-matters-that-are-within-the-control-of-the-undertaking-but-includes-information-on-material-risks-and-opportunities-attributable-to-business-relationships-beyond-the-scope-of-consolidation-used-in-the-preparation-of-financial-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>

<li><p>Where data from different levels, or multiple locations within a level, is aggregated, the undertaking shall ensure that this aggregation does not obscure the specificity and context necessary to interpret the information. The undertaking shall not aggregate material items that differ in nature.</p></li>
<li><p>When the undertaking presents information disaggregated by sectors, it shall adopt the ESRS sector classification to be specified in a delegated act adopted by the Commission pursuant to article 29b(1) third subparagraph, point (ii), of Directive 2013/34/EU.

<li><p>Due diligence</p></li>
<li><p>The outcome of the undertaking’s sustainability due diligence process (referred to as “due diligence” in the international instruments mentioned below) informs the undertaking’s assessment of its material impacts, risks and opportunities. ESRS do not impose any conduct requirements in relation to due diligence; nor do they extend or modify the role of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of the undertaking with regard to the conduct of due diligence.</p></li>
<li><p>Due diligence is the process by which undertakings identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address the actual and potential negative impacts on the environment and people connected with their business. These include negative impacts connected with the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. Due diligence is an on-going practice that responds to and may trigger changes in the undertaking’s strategy, business model, activities, business relationships, operating, sourcing and selling contexts. This process is described in the international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.</p></li>
<li><p>These international instruments identify a number of steps in the due diligence process, including the identification and assessment of negative impacts connected with the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. Where the undertaking cannot address all impacts at once, the due diligence process allows for action to be prioritised based on the severity and likelihood of the impacts. It is this aspect of the due diligence process that informs the assessment of material impacts (see section 3.4 of this Standard). The identification of material impacts also supports the identification of material sustainability risks and opportunities, which are often a product of such impacts.</p></li>
<li><p>The core elements of due diligence are reflected directly in Disclosure Requirements set out in ESRS 2 and in the topical ESRS, as illustrated below:</p></li>

</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="66">
<li><p>When determining at which level within its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain a material sustainability matter arises, the undertaking shall use its assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities following the double materiality principle (see chapter 3 of this Standard).</p></li>
<li><p>When associates or joint ventures, accounted for under the equity method or proportionally consolidated in the financial statements, are part of the undertaking’s value chain, for example as suppliers, the undertaking shall include information related to those associates or joint ventures in accordance with paragraph 63 consistent with the approach adopted for the other business relationships in the value chain. In this case, when determining impact metrics, the data of the associate or joint venture are not limited to the share of equity held, but shall be taken into account on the basis of the impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s products and services through its business relationships.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>5.2 Estimation using sector averages and proxies</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="68">
<li><p>The undertaking’s ability to obtain the necessary upstream and downstream value chain information may vary depending on various factors, such as the undertaking’s contractual arrangements, the level of control that it exercises on the operations outside the consolidation scope and its buying power. When the undertaking does not have the ability to control the activities of its upstream and/or downstream value chain and its business relationships, obtaining value chain information may be more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>There are circumstances where the undertaking cannot collect the information about its upstream and downstream value chain as required by paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts to do so. In these circumstances, the undertaking shall estimate the information to be reported about its upstream and downstream value chain, by using all reasonable and supportable information, such as sector-average data and other proxies.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtaining value chain information could also be challenging in the case of SMEs and other upstream and/or downstream value chain entities that are not in the scope of the sustainability reporting required by Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (see ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances).</p></li>
<li><p>With reference to policies, actions and targets, the undertaking’s reporting shall include upstream and/or downstream value chain information to the extent that those policies, actions and targets involve actors in the value chain. With reference to metrics, in many cases, in particular for environmental matters for which proxies are available, the undertaking may be able to comply with the reporting requirements without collecting data from the actors in its upstream and downstream value chain, especially from SMEs, for example, when calculating the undertaking’s GHG Scope 3 emissions.</p></li>

<p>Sometimes, it is impracticable to adjust comparative information for one or more prior periods to achieve comparability with the current period. For example, data might not have been collected in the prior period(s) in a way that allows either retrospective application of a new definition of a metric or target, or retrospective restatement to correct a prior period error, and it may be impracticable to recreate the information (see ESRS 2 BP-2). When it is impracticable to adjust comparative information for one or more prior periods, the undertaking shall disclose this fact.</p>
<p>When an ESRS requires the undertaking to present more than one comparative period for a metric or datapoint, the requirements of that ESRS shall prevail.</p>

<h1>Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#id16" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>When quantitative metrics and monetary amounts, including upstream and downstream value chain information (see chapter 5 of this Standard), cannot be measured directly and can only be estimated, measurement uncertainty may arise.</p>
<p>An undertaking shall disclose information to enable users to understand the most significant uncertainties affecting the quantitative metrics and monetary amounts reported in its sustainability statement.</p>
<p>The use of reasonable assumptions and estimates, including scenario or sensitivity analysis, is an essential part of preparing sustainability-related information and does not undermine the usefulness of that information, provided that the assumptions and estimates are accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily prevent such an assumption or estimate from providing useful information or meeting the qualitative characteristics of information (see Appendix B of this Standard).</p>
<p>Data and assumptions used in preparing the sustainability statement shall be consistent to the extent possible with the corresponding financial data and assumptions used in the undertaking’s financial statements.</p>
<p>Some ESRS require the disclosure of information such as explanations about possible future events that have uncertain outcomes. In judging whether information about such possible future events is material, the undertaking shall refer to the criteria in Chapter 3 of this Standard and consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) the potential financial effects of the events (the possible outcome);</p></li>
<li><p>(b) the severity and likelihood of the impacts on people or the environment resulting from the possible events, taking account of the factors of severity specified in paragraph 45; and</p></li>
<li><p>(c) the full range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible outcomes within that range.</p></li>

<p>The undertaking shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including information about low-probability and high-impact outcomes, which, when aggregated, could become material. For example, the undertaking might be exposed to several impacts or risks, each of which could cause the same type of disruption, such as disruptions to the undertaking’s supply chain. Information about an individual source of risk might not be material if disruption from that source is highly unlikely to occur. However, information about the aggregate risk of supply chain disruption from all sources might be material (see ESRS 2 BP-2).</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) redefined or replaced a metric or target;</p></li>

<p>Prior period errors are omissions from, and misstatements in, the undertaking’s sustainability statement for one or more prior periods. Such errors arise from a failure to use, or misuse of, reliable information that:</p>

<p>Such errors include: the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying the definitions for metrics or targets, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.</p>
<p>Potential errors in the current period discovered in that period are corrected before the management report is authorised for issuance. However, material errors are sometimes only discovered in a subsequent period.</p>

<p>The undertaking shall include in its sustainability statement the disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and the Council and to the Commission Delegated Regulations that specify the content and other modalities of those disclosures.

<h2>AR 6. In addition to the categories of stakeholder listed in paragraph 22, common categories of stakeholders are: employees and other workers, suppliers, consumers, customers, end-users, local communities and persons in vulnerable situations, and public authorities, including regulators, supervisors and central banks.<a class="headerlink" href="#ar-6-in-addition-to-the-categories-of-stakeholder-listed-in-paragraph-22-common-categories-of-stakeholders-are-employees-and-other-workers-suppliers-consumers-customers-end-users-local-communities-and-persons-in-vulnerable-situations-and-public-authorities-including-regulators-supervisors-and-central-banks" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>AR 7. Nature may be considered as a silent stakeholder. In this case, ecological data and data on the conservation of species may support the undertaking’s materiality assessment.</p>
<p>AR 8. Materiality assessment is informed by dialogue with affected stakeholders. The undertaking may engage with affected stakeholders or their representatives (such as employees or trade unions), along with users of sustainability reporting and other experts, to provide inputs or feedback on its conclusions regarding its material impacts, risks, and opportunities.</p>
<p>Assessment of impact materiality</p>
<p>AR 9. In assessing impact materiality and determining the material matters to be reported, the undertaking shall consider the following three steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) understanding of the context in relation to its impacts including its activities, business relationships, and stakeholders;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) identification of actual and potential impacts (both negative and positive), including through engaging with stakeholders and experts. In this step, the undertaking may rely on scientific and analytical research on impacts on sustainability matters;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) assessment of the materiality of its actual and potential impacts and determination of the material matters. In this step, the undertaking shall adopt thresholds to determine which of the impacts will be covered in its sustainability statement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of severity</p>
<p>AR 10. The severity is determined by the following factors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) scale: how grave the negative impact is or how beneficial the positive impact is for people or the environment;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) scope: how widespread the negative or positive impacts are. In the case of environmental impacts, the scope may be understood as the extent of environmental damage or a geographical perimeter. In the case of impacts on people, the scope may be understood as the number of people adversely affected; and</p></li>
<li><p>(c) irremediable character: whether and to what extent the negative impacts could be remediated, i.e., restoring the environment or affected people to their prior state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AR 11. Any of the three characteristics (scale, scope, and irremediable character) can make a negative impact severe. In the case of a potential negative human rights impact, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.</p>
<p>Impacts connected with the undertaking</p>
<p>AR 12. As an illustration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) if the undertaking uses cobalt in its products that is mined using child labour, the negative impact (i.e., child labour) is connected with the undertaking’s products through the tiers of business relationships in its upstream value chain. These relationships include the smelter and minerals trader and the mining enterprise that uses child labour; and</p></li>
<li><p>(b) if the undertaking provides financial loans to an enterprise for business activities that, in breach of agreed standards, result in the contamination of water and land surrounding the operations, this negative impact is connected with the undertaking through its relationship with the enterprise it provides the loans to.</p></li>

<p>AR 13. The following are examples of how impacts and dependencies are sources of risks or opportunities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) when the undertaking’s business model depends on a natural resource – for example water – it is likely to be affected by changes in the quality, availability and pricing of that resource;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) when the undertaking’s activities result in negative impacts, e.g., on local communities, the activities could become subject to stricter government regulation and/or the impact could trigger consequences of a reputational nature. These might have negative effects on the undertaking’s brand and higher recruitment costs might arise; and</p></li>
<li><p>(c) when the undertaking’s business partners face material sustainability-related risks, the undertaking could be exposed to related consequences as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AR 14. The identification of risks and opportunities that affect or could reasonably be expected to affect the undertaking’s financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term is the starting point for financial materiality assessment. In this context, the undertaking shall consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) the existence of dependencies on natural and social resources as sources of financial effects (see paragraph 50);</p></li>
<li><p>(b) their classification as sources of:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AR 15. Once the undertaking has identified its risks and opportunities, it shall determine which of them are material for reporting. This shall be based on a combination of (i) the likelihood of occurrence and (ii) the potential magnitude of financial effects determined on the basis of appropriate thresholds. In this step it shall consider the contribution of those risks and opportunities to financial effects in the short-, medium- and long-term based on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) scenarios/forecasts that are deemed likely to materialize; and</p></li>
<li><p>(b) potential financial effects related to sustainability matters deriving either from situations with a below the “more likely than not” threshold or assets/liabilities not, or not yet, reflected in financial statements. This includes:</p></li>

When, as a result of the undertaking’s materiality assessment (see ESRS 2 IRO-1), a given sustainability matter in this list is assessed to be material, the undertaking shall report according to the corresponding Disclosure Requirements of the relevant topical ESRS. Using this list is not a substitute for the process of determining material matters. This list is a tool to support the undertaking’s materiality assessment. The undertaking still needs to consider its own specific circumstances when determining its material matters.

<p>Estimation using sector averages and proxies</p>
<p>AR 17. When the undertaking cannot collect upstream and downstream value chain information as required by paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts to do so, it shall estimate the information to be reported using all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the undertaking at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. This includes, but is not limited to, internal and external information, such as data from indirect sources, sector-average data, sample analyses, market and peer groups data, other proxies or spend-based data.</p>
<p>Content and structure of the sustainability statement</p>
<p>AR 18. As an illustration for paragraph 115 in section 8.2 Content and structure of the sustainability statement of this Standard, the undertaking that covers environmental and social matters in the same policy may cross-refer. That means that the undertaking may report on the policy in its environmental disclosures and cross-refer to it from the relevant social disclosures or vice versa. Consolidated presentation of policies across topics is allowed.</p>

<p>Flowchart for determining disclosures under ESRS</p>
<p>Materiality assessment is the starting point for sustainability reporting under ESRS. This appendix provides a non-binding illustration of the impact- and financial materiality assessment outlined in chapter 3. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2 includes general disclosure requirements (DR) about the undertaking’s process to identify impacts, risks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2 provides general disclosures requirements on the material impact, risks and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s materiality assessment. The undertaking can omit all disclosure requirements in a topical standard if it assessed that the topic in question is not material. In that case it may disclose a brief explanation of the conclusions of the materiality assessment for that topic but shall disclose a detailed explanation in the case of ESRS E1 climate change (IRO-2 ESRS 2). ESRS set disclosure requirements, not behavioral requirements. Disclosure requirements in relation to action plans, targets, policies, scenario analysis and transition plans are proportionate because they are contingent on the undertaking having these, which may depend on the size, capacity, resources, and skills of the undertaking. Note: The flowchart below does not cover the situation in which the undertaking assesses a sustainability matter as material but it is not covered by a topical standard, in which case the undertaking shall make additional entity specific disclosures (ESRS 1 (30 (b)).</p>

<p>When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34(c) on base year and baseline value:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) the undertaking shall briefly explain how it has ensured that the baseline value against which the progress towards the target is measured is representative in terms of the activities covered and the influences from external factors (e.g., temperature anomalies in a certain year influencing the amount of energy consumption and related GHG emissions). This can be done by the normalization of the baseline value, or, by using a baseline value that is derived from a 3-year average if this increases the representativeness and allows a more faithful representation;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in either the target or reporting boundary occur. In such a case, the undertaking shall explain how the new baseline value affects the new target, its achievement and presentation of progress over time. To foster comparability, when setting new targets, the undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting year of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the target year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be selected from the period between 2022 and 2025;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) the undertaking shall update its base year from 2030 and after every 5-year period thereafter. This means that before 2030, the base years chosen by undertakings’ may be either the currently applied base year for existing targets or the first year of application of the sustainability reporting requirements as set out in Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 (2024, 2025 or 2026) and, after 2030, every 5 years (2030, 2035, etc); and</p></li>
<li><p>(d) when presenting climate-related targets, the undertaking may disclose the progress in meeting these targets made before its current base year. In doing so, the undertaking shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the information on past progress is consistent with the requirements of this Standard. In the case of methodological differences, for example, regarding target boundaries, the undertaking shall provide a brief explanation for these differences.</p></li>

<p>AR 29. The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the undertaking’s GHG emission reduction target. As a result, the reference target value for undertakings with a recent base year or from higher baseline emissions may be less challenging to achieve than it will be for undertakings that have already taken ambitious past actions to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings that have in the past achieved GHG emissions reductions compatible with either a 1.5°C-aligned cross-sector or sector-specific pathway, may adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference target value. Accordingly, if the undertaking is adjusting the baseline emissions to determine the reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission reductions that precede the year 2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG emission reduction.</p>
<p>AR 30. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34 (f), the undertaking shall explain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) by reference to its climate change mitigation actions, the decarbonisation levers and their estimated quantitative contributions to the achievement of its GHG emission reduction targets broken down by each Scope (1, 2 and 3);</p></li>
<li><p>(b) whether it plans to adopt new technologies and the role of these to achieve its GHG emission reduction targets;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) whether and how it has considered a diverse range of climate scenarios, at least including a climate scenario compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, to detect relevant environmental-, societal-, technology-, market- and policy-related developments and determine its decarbonisation levers.</p></li>

<p>(d) apply the location-based and market-based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions and provide information on the share and types of contractual instruments. Location-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on average energy generation emission factors for defined locations, including local, subnational, or national boundaries (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015). Market-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on GHG emissions emitted by the generators from which the reporting entity contractually purchases electricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments on their own (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015); in this case, the undertaking may disclose the share of market-based scope 2 GHG emissions linked to purchased electricity bundled with instruments such as Guarantee of Origins or Renewable Energy Certificates. The undertaking shall provide information about the share and types of contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims.</p>

<h1>GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits<a class="headerlink" href="#ghg-mitigation-projects-financed-through-carbon-credits" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>AR 61. Financing GHG emission reduction projects outside the undertaking’s value chain through purchasing carbon credits that fulfil high-quality standards can be a useful contribution towards mitigating climate change. This Standard requires the undertaking to disclose whether it uses carbon credits separately from the GHG emissions (paragraphs 56 (b) and 59) and GHG emission reduction targets (Disclosure Requirement E1-4). It also requires the undertaking to show the extent of use and which quality criteria it uses for those carbon credits.</p>
<p>AR 62. When disclosing the information on carbon credits required under paragraphs 56 (b) and 59, the undertaking shall disclose the following disaggregation as applicable:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) the share (percentage of volume) of reduction projects and removal projects;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) for carbon credits from removal projects, an explanation whether they are from biogenic or technological sinks;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) the share (percentage of volume) for each recognised quality standard;</p></li>
<li><p>(d) the share (percentage of volume) issued from projects in the EU; and</p></li>
<li><p>(e) the share (percentage of volume) that qualifies as a corresponding adjustment under Article. 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Calculation guidance</p>
<p>AR 63. When preparing the information on carbon credits required under paragraphs 56 (b) and 59, the undertaking shall:</p>

<li><p>(a) Consider recognised quality standards;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) if applicable, explain the role of carbon credits in its climate change mitigation policy;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) not include carbon credits issued from GHG emission reduction projects within its value chain as the respective GHG emission reductions shall already be disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1-6 (Scope 2 or Scope 3) at the time they occur (i.e., double counting is avoided);</p></li>
<li><p>(d) not include carbon credits from GHG removal projects within its value chain as the respective GHG removals may already be accounted for under Disclosure Requirement E1-7 at the time they occur (i.e., double counting is avoided);</p></li>
<li><p>(e) not disclose carbon credits as an offset for its GHG emissions under Disclosure Requirement E1-6 on GHG emissions;</p></li>
<li><p>(f) not disclose carbon credits as a means to reach the GHG emission reduction targets disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1-4; and</p></li>

<p>(e) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s pollution-related impacts and dependencies.</p>
<p>This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability matters: pollution of air, water, soil, substances of concern, including substances of very high concern.</p>
<p>“Pollution of air” refers to the undertaking’s emissions into air (both indoor and outdoor), and prevention, control and reduction of such emissions.</p>
<p>“Pollution of water” refers to the undertaking’s emissions to water, and prevention, control and reduction of such emissions.</p>
<p>“Pollution of soil” refers to the undertaking’s emissions into soil and the prevention, control and reduction of such emissions.</p>
<p>With regard to “substances of concern”, this standard covers the undertaking’s production, use and/or distribution and commercialization of substances of concern, including substances of very high concern. Disclosure Requirements on substances of concern aim at providing users with an understanding of actual or potential impacts related to such substances, also taking account of possible restrictions on their use and/or distribution and commercialization.</p>
<p>Interaction with other ESRS</p>
<p>The topic of pollution is closely connected to other environmental sub-topics such as climate change, water and marine resources, biodiversity and circular economy. Thus, to provide a comprehensive overview of what could be material to pollution, relevant Disclosure Requirements are covered in other environmental Standards as follows:</p>

<p>AR 18. The undertaking may relate significant monetary amounts of CapEx and OpEx required to implement the actions taken or planned to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>the relevant line items or notes in the financial statements;</p></li>

</ol>
<p>AR 19. The undertaking may disclose whether it considers an “avoidance” action plan, which prevents damaging actions before they take place. Avoidance often involves a decision to deviate from the business-as-usual project development path. An example of avoidance is altering the biodiversity and ecosystem footprint of a project to avoid destruction of natural habitat on the site and/or establishing set-asides where priority biodiversity values are present and will be conserved. At a minimum, avoidance should be considered where there are biodiversity and ecosystem-related values that are in one of the following categories: particularly vulnerable and irreplaceable, of particular concern to stakeholders, or where a cautious approach is warranted due to uncertainty about impact assessment or about the efficacy of management measures. The three main types of avoidance are defined below:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Avoidance through site selection (Locate the entire project away from areas recognized for important biodiversity values);</p></li>
<li><p>Avoidance through project design (Configure infrastructure to preserve areas at the project site with important biodiversity values); and</p></li>
<li><p>Avoidance through scheduling (Time project activities to account for patterns of species behavior (e.g., breeding, migration) or ecosystem functions (e.g., river dynamics).</p></li>

<p>(a) primary data: collected in-situ using on pe ground surveys;
(b) secondary data: including geospatial data layers pat are overlaid wip geographic location data of business activities.
i. At pe species level, data layers on pe ranges of different species can be used to predict pe species pat may be present at different locations. This includes operation sites and sourcing locations. Different range layers will have different levels of accuracy depending on certain factors (e.g., wheper species ranges have been refined based on availability of habitat). Information on pe preat status of pe species, and pe activities pat preaten pem, can provide an indication of pe likely contribution pat business activities may be having on driving population trends and preat status.
ii. At pe ecosystem level, data layers reflecting change in pe extent and condition of ecosystems can be applied, including levels of habitat fragmentation and connectivity.
(c) modelled biodiversity state data: Model-based approaches are commonly used for measuring ecosystem level indicators (e.g., extent, condition, or function). Models quantify how pe magnitude of different pressures affects pe state of biodiversity. These are referred to as pressure-state relationships and are based on globally collected data. Modelling results are applied locally to estimate how undertaking-level pressures will cause changes in ecosystem condition. An impact driver generally has pree main characteristics: magnitude (e.g., amount of contaminant, noise intensity), spatial extent (e.g., area of land contaminated) and temporal extent (duration of persistence of contaminant).</p>

<p>Circular economy means an economic system in which the value of products, materials and other resources in the economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle, including through the application of the waste hierarchy. The goal is to maximise and maintain the value of the technical and biological resources, products and materials by creating a system that allows for durability, optimal use or re-use, refurbishment, remanufacturing, recycling and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This Standard builds on relevant EU legislative frameworks and policies including the EU Circular Economy Action Plan, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (83) (Waste Framework Directive) and the EU industrial strategy.</p>
<p>To evaluate the transition from business as usual, meaning an economy in which finite resources are extracted to make products that are used and then thrown away (“take-make-waste”), to a circular economic system, this Standard relies on the identification of the physical flows of resources, materials and products used and generated by the undertaking through Disclosure Requirement E5-4 Resource inflows and Disclosure Requirement E5-5 Resource outflows.</p>
<p>Resource use is a major driver of other environmental impacts such as climate change, pollution, water and marine resources and biodiversity. A circular economy is a system that tends towards sustainable use of resources in extraction, processing, production, consumption and management of waste. Such system brings multiple environmental benefits, in particular, the reduction of material and energy consumption and emissions into the air (greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution), the limitation of water withdrawals and discharges and the regeneration of nature limiting the impact on biodiversity.</p>
<p>To provide a comprehensive overview of which other environmental matters could be material to resource use and circular economy, relevant disclosure requirements are covered in other environmental ESRS as follows:</p>
<p>(a) ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses, in particular, GHG emissions and energy resources (energy consumption);</p>
<p>(b) ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses, in particular, emissions to water, air and soil as well as substances of concern;</p>

<p>AR 2. With regard to ESRS E5, phases 1 and 2 rely mainly on the materiality assessments conducted under ESRS E1 (including energy consumption), ESRS E2 (pollution), ESRS E3 (marine resources, water consumption) and ESRS E4 (biodiversity, ecosystems, raw materials). Indeed, circular economy eventually aims at reducing the environmental impact of the use of products, materials and other resources, minimizing waste and the release of hazardous substances and hence at reducing impacts on nature. This application requirement focuses mainly on the third phase of this LEAP approach, while the fourth phase addresses the outcome of the process.</p>
<p>AR 3. The process to assess the materiality of impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities shall consider the provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities and IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement.</p>
<p>AR 4. The sub-topics related to resource use and circular economy covered by the materiality assessment include:</p>
<p>(a) resource inflows including pe circularity of material resource inflows, considering resource use optimisation, intensity of materials and products and renewable and non-renewable resources;
(b) resource outflows related to products and services;
(c) waste, including hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste management.</p>
<p>AR 5. In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking may:</p>
<p>(a) identify transition risks and opportunities in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, including pe risk of staying in a business-as-usual scenario:
i. policy and legal, e.g., bans on pe extraction and use of non-renewable resources, regulations on waste treatment;
ii. technology, e.g., introduction on pe market of new technologies to replace existing use of products and materials;
iii. market, e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing;
iv. reputation, e.g. changing societal, customer or community perceptions.</p>

<p>This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S1 Own workforce. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of this Standard.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>AR 1. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of its own workforce during a pandemic.</p>
<p>AR 2. The overview of social matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be reported on in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, they provide a list of matters derived from the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2013/34/EU that the undertaking shall consider for the ESRS 2 materiality assessment related to its own workforce and, as appropriate, report as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.</p>

<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders</p>
<p>AR 4. ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of whether and how it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating significant material impacts on its own workforce, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.</p>

<h1>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model<a class="headerlink" href="#id341" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>AR 6. Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce can originate in its strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).</p>
<p>AR 7. Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of opportunities for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a “just transition”. Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.</p>
<p>AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking’s own workforce that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on “zero hours” contracts).</p>
<p>AR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on its own workforce where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking’s workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and own workforce.</p>

It may disclose communication tools and channels (for example, flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face interactions, workers’ representatives), aimed at ensuring that the policy is accessible and that different audiences understand its implications.

<p>Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time employees, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose contextual information to help information users interpret the data. The undertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.</p>

<p>This Disclosure Requirement provides insight into the undertaking’s approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures. This disclosure covers both individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (“self-employed people”) and workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78).

<p>AR 63. If the undertaking cannot report exact figures, it shall use estimates according to the provisions in ESRS 1 to disclose the number of people in its own workforce who are not employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of people in its own workforce who are not employees is greater than 1 000, to the nearest 100, and explain this.

<p>AR 64. Disclosing the number of people in the undertaking’s own workforce who are not employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Disclosing this number as an average across the reporting period considers fluctuations during the reporting period and can provide more insightful and relevant information for users.</p>
<p>AR 65. The information disclosed by the undertaking allows users to understand how the number of non-employees in the undertaking’s own workforce varies during the reporting period or compared to the previous reporting period (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). The undertaking may also disclose the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of non-employees during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of non-employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project. If the undertaking discloses fluctuations, it shall also explain the criteria used to determine which fluctuations it discloses. If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of non-employees during the reporting period or between the current and previous reporting period, the undertaking may disclose this information.</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement S1-8 – Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue</p>
<p>Collective bargaining coverage</p>
<p>AR 66. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements is calculated using the following formula:Number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 100 Number of employees</p>
<p>AR 67. The employees in the undertaking’s own workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements are those individuals to whom the undertaking is obliged to apply the agreement. This means that if none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee in the undertaking’s own workforce covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be counted once.</p>

<p>For example, negative impacts on value chain workers may disrupt the undertaking’s operations (through customers refusing to buy its products or state agencies impounding its goods) and harm its reputation. Conversely, respect for workers’ rights and active support programmes (for example through financial literacy initiatives) can bring business opportunities, such as more reliable supply or widening of the future consumer base.</p>

<p>This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of ESRS S2.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>AR 1. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of value chain workers during a pandemic.</p>
<p>AR 2. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to value chain workers and, as appropriate, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.</p>

<p>Strategy</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 - Interests and views of stakeholders</p>
<p>AR 4. Disclosure Requirement ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of whether and how it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating significant material impacts on value chain workers, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.</p>
<p>AR 5. While value chain workers may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking may disclose the views of the value chain workers and value chain workers’ representatives.</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model</p>
<p>AR 6. Impacts on value chain workers can originate in the undertaking’s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in the upstream and</p>

<h2>210/284 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj<a class="headerlink" href="#id399" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>downstream value chains), its value chain (such as relying on commodities of unclear provenance, without visibility on impacts on workers), or its cost structure and the revenue model (e.g. shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of their workers).</p>
<p>AR 7. Impacts on value chain workers that originate in the strategy or the business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, undertakings that rely on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Another example is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure may sub-contract production, leading to lower quality, and a longer, less transparent, and less controllable supply chain. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.</p>
<p>AR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of value chain workers that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 12 relate to young workers that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women workers in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrant workers in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some workers, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (e.g., workers required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid workers who are on “zero hours” contracts).</p>
<p>AR 9. With regard to paragraph 13, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on workers at all stages of the value chain resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting value chain workers working for logistics providers. For example, if some workers in the undertaking’s value chain are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour.</p>

<p>Disclosure Requirement S2-1 – Policies related to value chain workers</p>
<p>AR 10. If the policies are limited to the undertaking’s own workforce and do not cover workers in upstream and downstream entities and relationships, they shall be disclosed under ESRS S1 and not in relation to this requirement.</p>
<p>AR 11. If the disclosures under ESRS S1 include information relevant for workers in the value chain, a reference to this can be made here; disclosures on the remaining elements shall then be fulfilled under this Disclosure Requirement.</p>
<p>AR 12. The undertaking may disclose explanations of significant changes to the policies adopted during the reporting year (e.g., new expectations for suppliers, new or additional approaches to due diligence and remedy).</p>

<h2>AR 35. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by the undertaking and the effective management of impacts. For example, to show the effectiveness of its actions to support its suppliers with improving their working conditions, the undertaking may disclose survey feedback from the suppliers’ workers showing that working conditions have improved since the time the undertaking began working with those suppliers. Additional information that the undertaking may provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified through for instance, independent audits.<a class="headerlink" href="#ar-35-reporting-on-effectiveness-is-aimed-at-enabling-the-understanding-of-the-links-between-actions-taken-by-the-undertaking-and-the-effective-management-of-impacts-for-example-to-show-the-effectiveness-of-its-actions-to-support-its-suppliers-with-improving-their-working-conditions-the-undertaking-may-disclose-survey-feedback-from-the-suppliers-workers-showing-that-working-conditions-have-improved-since-the-time-the-undertaking-began-working-with-those-suppliers-additional-information-that-the-undertaking-may-provide-includes-data-showing-a-decrease-in-the-number-of-incidents-identified-through-for-instance-independent-audits" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>AR 36. With regard to initiatives or processes the undertaking has in place that are based on affected workers’ needs and with regard to progress in the implementation of such initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) information about whether and how value chain workers and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these programmes or processes; and</p></li>
<li><p>(b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for value chain workers of these initiatives or processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AR 37. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for value chain workers are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 8 to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” the undertaking may be providing capacity-building to smallholders in its supply chain, resulting in increases in their income; or it may be supporting training to increase the proportion of women able to take delivery jobs in its downstream value chain.</p>
<p>AR 38. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for value chain workers a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (e.g., that x number of workers have received financial literacy training) from evidence of actual outcomes for workers (e.g., that x workers report that they are able to better manage their household budgets so as to meet their savings goals).</p>
<p>AR 39. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may e.g., consider programmes that aim to advance women workers’ financial literacy that have resulted in more women being promoted as well as in reports of reduced sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p>AR 40. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on value chain workers, the undertaking may consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on value chain workers may include the reputational or legal exposure where value chain workers are found to be subject to forced labour or child labour;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers may include disruption of business operations where a pandemic closes significant parts of its supply chain or distribution network;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on value chain workers may include market differentiation and greater customer appeal from guaranteeing decent pay and conditions for non-employee workers; and</p></li>
<li><p>(d) business opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers might include the achievement of a future sustainable supply of a commodity by ensuring smallholder farmers earn enough to persuade future generations to keep farming that crop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AR 41. When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.</p>
<p>AR 42. When disclosing policies, actions and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.</p>
<p>AR 43. The undertaking shall consider whether and how its process(es) to manage material risks related to value chain workers are integrated into its existing risk management process(es).</p>

<h1>Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#id425" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on affected communities connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) how the undertaking affects communities, in areas where impacts are most likely to be present and severe, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on affected communities, and how the undertaking manages them; and</p></li>
<li><p>(d) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on affected communities.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on affected communities in relation to:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) communities’ economic, social and cultural rights (for example, adequate housing, adequate food, water and sanitation, land-related and security-related impacts);</p></li>
<li><p>(b) communities’ civil and political rights (for example, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, impacts on human rights defenders); and</p></li>
<li><p>(c) particular rights of indigenous peoples (for example, free, prior and informed consent, self-determination, cultural rights).</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative relationships with affected communities may disrupt the undertaking’s own operations or harm its reputation, while constructive relationships can bring business benefits, such as stable and conflict-free operations and a greater ease of recruiting locally.</p></li>

<h1>Appendix A<a class="headerlink" href="#id439" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Application Requirements</p>
<p>This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S3 Affected communities. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>AR 1. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to affected communities and, as appropriate, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.</p>
<p>AR 2. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the impacts on communities related to the undertaking’s operations due to extreme and sudden weather conditions.</p>
<p>ESRS 2 General Disclosures</p>
<p>Strategy</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders</p>
<p>AR 3. Disclosure Requirement ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of if and how it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating significant material impacts on affected communities, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.</p>
<p>AR 4. While affected communities may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking may disclose the views of affected communities and affected communities’ representatives.</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model</p>
<p>AR 5. Impacts on affected communities can originate in the undertaking’s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as, construction or commencement of projects with timelines that do not allow sufficient time for consultation with groups affected by the projects), its value chain (for example, land-use in countries in which ownership is often contested or records are unreliable or in which land-users such as indigenous peoples are unrecognised), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as, aggressive strategies to minimise taxation, particularly with respect to operations in developing countries).</p>

<h2>AR 6. Impacts on affected communities that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, where the undertaking’s strategy involves moving into higher risk geographies in pursuit of certain commodities, and if affected communities resist its presence or object to its local practices, this may create extensive and costly delays, and affect the undertaking’s ability to secure future land concessions or permits. Similarly, if the undertaking’s business model relies on intensive water extraction at its plants, to the extent that it affects access to water for communities’ consumption, hygiene and livelihoods, this may result in reputationally-damaging boycotts, complaints and lawsuits.<a class="headerlink" href="#ar-6-impacts-on-affected-communities-that-originate-in-the-strategy-or-business-model-can-also-bring-material-risks-to-the-undertaking-for-example-where-the-undertakings-strategy-involves-moving-into-higher-risk-geographies-in-pursuit-of-certain-commodities-and-if-affected-communities-resist-its-presence-or-object-to-its-local-practices-this-may-create-extensive-and-costly-delays-and-affect-the-undertakings-ability-to-secure-future-land-concessions-or-permits-similarly-if-the-undertakings-business-model-relies-on-intensive-water-extraction-at-its-plants-to-the-extent-that-it-affects-access-to-water-for-communities-consumption-hygiene-and-livelihoods-this-may-result-in-reputationally-damaging-boycotts-complaints-and-lawsuits" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>

<h1>AR 7<a class="headerlink" href="#id440" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Examples of particular characteristics of affected communities that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 10 may be an affected community that is physically or economically isolated and is particularly susceptible to introduced diseases or has limited access to social services and therefore relies on infrastructure set up by the undertaking. It may be because where land worked by women is purchased by the undertaking and payments go to male heads of households, women become further disenfranchised in the community. It may also be because the community is indigenous, and its members seek to exercise cultural or economic rights to the land owned or used by the undertaking – or by one of the entities with which it has a business relationship – in a context where their rights are not protected by the state. In addition, the undertaking shall consider whether different characteristics overlap. For example, characteristics such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, migrant status and gender may create overlapping risks of harm for certain affected communities, or for distinct parts of those affected communities, since affected communities are often heterogeneous in nature.</p>

<section id="id441">
<h1>AR 8<a class="headerlink" href="#id441" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>With regard to paragraph 11, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on affected communities where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a natural disaster leads to a catastrophic industrial accident involving the undertaking’s operations, resulting in severe harm to affected communities.</p>

<p>The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on consumers and end-users connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) how the undertaking affects the consumers and/or end-users of its products and/or services (referred to in this Standard as “consumers and end-users”), in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on consumers and end-users, and how the undertaking manages such risks and opportunities; and</p></li>
<li><p>(d) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on consumers and/or end-users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on the consumers and/or end-users related to its products and/or services in relation to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) information-related impacts on consumers and/or end-users (for example, privacy, freedom of expression and access to (quality) information;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) personal safety of consumers and/or end-users (for example, health and safety, security of a person and protection of children);</p></li>
<li><p>(c) social inclusion of consumers and/or end-users (for example, non-discrimination, access to products and services and responsible marketing practices).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative impacts on the reputation of the undertaking’s products and/or services can be detrimental to its business performance, while trust in products and/or services can bring business benefits, such as increased sales or widening of the future consumer base.</p>
<p>The unlawful use or misuse of the undertaking’s products and services by consumers and end-users fall outside the scope of this standard.</p>

<h1>Application Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#id502" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users. It supports the application of the requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>AR 1. The undertaking may highlight special issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of consumers and/or end-users in relation to contamination of a product or severe breach of privacy due to a massive data leak.</p>
<p>AR 2. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to consumers and/or end-users and, subsequently, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.</p>
<p>ESRS 2 General disclosures</p>
<p>Strategy</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders</p>
<p>AR 3. ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of if and how it considers whether its strategy and business model play a role in creating, exacerbating or (conversely) mitigating significant material impacts on consumers and/or end-users, and whether and how the business model and strategy are adapted to address such material impacts.</p>
<p>AR 4. While consumers and/or end-users may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model, their views can inform the undertaking’s assessment of its strategy and business model. The undertaking may disclose the views of the (actual or potential) materially affected consumers and/or end-users’ legitimate representatives or those of credible proxies that have insight into their situation.</p>
<p>Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model</p>
<p>AR 5. Impacts on consumers and/or end-users can originate in the undertaking’s business model or strategy in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (for example, providing online platforms with potential for online and offline harm), its value chain (for example, speed in developing products or services, or delivering projects, with risks to health and safety), or its cost structure and the revenue model (for example, sales-maximising incentives that put consumers at risk).</p>
<p>AR 6. Impacts on consumers and/or end-users that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, if the undertaking’s business model is premised on incentivising its sales force to sell high volumes of a product or service (for example, credit cards or pain medicine) at speed, and this results in large-scale harm to consumers, the undertaking may face lawsuits and reputational damage affecting its future business and credibility.</p>

Examples of particular characteristics of consumers and/or end-users that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 11 include young consumers and/or end-users who may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or who lack financial literacy and may be more susceptible to exploitative sales or marketing practices.

<p>With regard to paragraph 12, the risks could arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on consumers and/or end-users where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects, for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe impacts on certain consumers’ livelihoods resulting in major changes in patterns of consumption.</p>

<p>consumers and/or end-users that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes. To illustrate the usage level of such channels, the undertaking may disclose the number of complaints received from consumers and/or end-users during the reporting period.</p>
<p>AR 24. In describing the effectiveness of channels for consumers and/or end-users to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for nonjudicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The below considerations may be applied on an individual channel basis or for the collective system of channels:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) do the channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?</p></li>
<li><p>(b) are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?</p></li>
<li><p>(c) do the channels have known procedures, set timeframes and clarity on the processes?</p></li>
<li><p>(d) do the channels ensure reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise?</p></li>
<li><p>(e) do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and where applicable, to meet any public interest at stake?</p></li>
<li><p>(f) do the outcomes achieved from the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?</p></li>
<li><p>(g) does the undertaking identify insights from the channels that support continuous learning in both improving the channels and preventing future impacts?</p></li>
<li><p>(h) does the undertaking focus on dialogue with complainants as the means to reach agreed solutions, rather than seeking to unilaterally determine the outcome?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Disclosure Requirement S4-4 – Taking action on material impacts on consumers and end-users, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to consumers and end-users, and effectiveness of those actions</p>
<p>AR 25. It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its downstream value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice). Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(a) Its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;</p></li>
<li><p>(b) its initiatives aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;</p></li>
<li><p>(c) how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and</p></li>
<li><p>(d) its aims for continued improvement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AR 26. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.</p>
<p>AR 27. Given that material negative impacts affecting consumers and/or end-users that have occurred during the reporting period may also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use leverage with relevant business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on proper product use or sale practices to business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible marketing or product safety).</p>

<p>AR 43. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to material impacts. For example, a target to ensure equal access to finance for underserved consumers could both reduce discrimination impacts on those consumers and enlarge the undertaking’s pool of customers.</p>
<p>AR 44. The undertaking may also distinguish between short, medium and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have as a main objective to make its online services accessible to people with disabilities, with the long-term goal of having adapted 100% of its online services by 2025, and with the short-term objective of adding x number of accessible features every year up and until 2025.</p>
<p>AR 45. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.</p>

<h1>Grievance mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#grievance-mechanism" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Any routinized, state-based or non-state-based, judicial or non-judicial processes through which stakeholders can raise grievances and seek remedy. Examples of state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms include courts, labour tribunals, national human rights institutions, National Contact Points under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson offices, consumer protection agencies, regulatory oversight bodies, and government-run complaints offices. Non-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered by the undertaking, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organisations, civil society organisations, or multi-stakeholder groups. Operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organisation either alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organisation’s stakeholders. They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing both harm and grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the organisation’s due diligence from those who are directly affected. According to UN Guiding Principle 31, effective grievance mechanisms are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also based on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organisation to assess the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has established itself.</p>

<h1>Indirect impact drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#indirect-impact-drivers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Indirect impact drivers operate diffusely by altering and influencing direct drivers (by affecting their level, direction or rate) as well as other indirect drivers. Interactions between indirect and direct drivers create different chains of relationship, attribution, and impacts, which may vary according to type, intensity, duration, and distance. These relationships can also lead to different types of spill-over effects. Global indirect drivers include economic, demographic, governance, technological and cultural ones. Special attention is given, among indirect drivers, to the role of institutions (both formal and informal) and impacts of the patterns of production, supply and consumption on nature, nature’s contributions to people and good quality of life.</p>

<p>There is no single definition for indigenous peoples agreed on at the international level. In practice, there is convergence among international agencies on what groups can be considered indigenous peoples and should enjoy special protection as such. An important criteria for defining indigenous people is related to their connection to a traditional area, as defined in ILO Convention No. 169, Article 1, which states that the convention applies to: “(a) tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations; (b) peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions”. ILO Convention 169 also states in Article 1(2) that: “[s]elf-identification as indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the provisions of this Convention apply”.</p>

<p>Indirect GHG emissions: GHG emissions that are a consequence of the activities of an entity but occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity. Indirect emissions are Scope 2 GHG emissions and scope 3 GHG emissions combined.</p>
<p>Installation: A stationary technical unit within which one or more activities are carried out which could have an effect on emissions and pollution.</p>
<p>Internal carbon price: Price used by an undertaking to assess the financial implications of changes to investment, production, and consumption patterns, and of potential technological progress and future emissions abatement costs.</p>
<p>Internal carbon pricing scheme: An organisational arrangement that allows an undertaking to apply carbon prices in strategic and operational decision making. There are two types of internal carbon prices commonly used by undertakings. The first type is a shadow price, which is a theoretical cost or notional amount that the undertaking does not charge but that can be used in assessing the economic implications or trade-offs for such things as risk impacts, new investments, net present value of projects, and the cost-benefit of various initiatives. The second type is an internal tax or fee, which is a carbon price charged to a business activity, product line, or other business unit based on its GHG emissions (these internal taxes or fees are similar to intracompany transfer pricing).</p>
<p>Invasive or alien species: Species whose introduction and/or spread by human action outside their natural distribution threatens biological diversity, food security, and human health and well-being. “Alien” refers to the species having been introduced outside its natural distribution (“exotic”, “non-native” and “non-indigenous” are synonyms for “alien”). “Invasive” means “tending to expand into and modify ecosystems to which it has been introduced”. Thus, a species may be alien without being invasive, or, in the case of a species native to a region, it may increase and become invasive, without actually being an alien species.</p>
<p>Key Biodiversity Area (KBA): Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Sites qualify as global KBAs if they meet one or more of 11 criteria, clustered into five categories: threatened biodiversity; geographically restricted biodiversity; ecological integrity; biological processes; and, irreplaceability. The World Database of KBAs is managed by BirdLife International on behalf of the KBA Partnership.</p>
<p>Land degradation: The many processes that drive the decline or loss in biodiversity, ecosystem functions or their benefits to people and includes the degradation of all terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Landfill: A waste disposal site for the deposit of the waste onto or into land.</p>
<p>Land-system (change): The terrestrial component of the Earth system, encompassing all processes and activities related to the human use of land. These include socio-economic, technological and organisational inputs and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities. The land-systems concept</p>

Nature-related physical risks are a direct result of an organisation’s dependence on nature. Physical risks arise when natural systems are compromised, due to the impact of climatic events (e.g., extremes of weather such as a drought), geologic events (e.g., seismic events such as an earthquake) events or changes in ecosystem equilibria, such as soil quality or marine ecology, which affect the ecosystem services organisations depend on. These can be acute, chronic, or both. Nature-related physical risks arise as a result of changes in the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) conditions that support healthy, functioning ecosystems. Physical risks are usually location-specific. Nature-related physical risks are often associated with climate-related physical risks.</p>

<section id="systemic-risks">
<h1>Systemic risks<a class="headerlink" href="#systemic-risks" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Risks arising from the breakdown of the entire system, rather than the failure of individual parts. They are characterised by modest tipping points combining indirectly to produce large failures with cascading of interactions of physical and transition risks (contagion), as one loss triggers a chain of others, and with systems unable to recover equilibrium after a shock. An example is the loss of a keystone species, such as sea otters, which have a critical role in ecosystem community structure. When sea otters were hunted to near extinction in the 1900s, the coastal ecosystems flipped and biomass production was greatly reduced.</p>

<h1>Value Chain<a class="headerlink" href="#id586" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>A value chain encompasses the activities, resources and relationships the undertaking uses and relies on to create its products or services from conception to delivery, consumption and end-of-life. Relevant activities, resources and relationships include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>those in the undertaking’s own operations, such as human resources;</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Value chain includes actors upstream and downstream from the undertaking. Actors upstream from the undertaking (e.g., suppliers) provide products or services that are used in the development of the undertaking’s products or services. Entities downstream from the undertaking (e.g., distributors, customers) receive products or services from the undertaking.</p>
<p>ESRS use the term “value chain” in the singular, although it is recognised that undertakings may have multiple value chains.</p>

</section>
<section id="water-scarcity">
<h1>Water scarcity<a class="headerlink" href="#water-scarcity" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. Scarcity is human driven, it is a function of the volume of human water consumption relative to the volume of water resources in a given area. As such, an arid region with very little water, but no human water consumption would not be considered scarce, but rather arid. Water scarcity is a physical, objective reality that can be measured consistently across regions and over time. Water scarcity reflects the physical abundance of freshwater rather than whether that water is suitable for use. For instance, a region may have abundant water resources (and thus not be considered water scarce) but have such severe pollution that those supplies are unfit for human or ecological uses.</p>
