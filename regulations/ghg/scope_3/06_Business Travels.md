### description 

This category includes emissions from the transportation of employees for business related activities in vehicles owned or operated by third parties, such as aircraft, trains, buses, and passenger cars. Emissions from transportation in vehicles owned or controlled by the reporting company are accounted for in either scope 1 (for fuel use), or in the case of electric vehicles, scope 2 (for electricity use).  Emissions from transportation of employees to and from work are accounted for in scope 3, category 7 (Employee commuting). 

**Emissions from business travel may arise from:**

- Air travel
- Rail travel
- Bus travel
- Automobile travel (e.g., business travel in rental cars or employee-owned vehicles other than employee commuting
to and from work)
- Other modes of travel.

Companies may optionally include emissions from business travelers staying in hotels. 

**Calculating emissions from transportation**

Companies may use one of the following methods to calculate scope 3 emissions from business travel: 
- Fuel-based method, which involves determining the amount of fuel consumed during business travel (i.e., scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of transport providers) and applying the appropriate emission factor for that fuel 
- Distance-based method, which involves determining the distance and mode of business trips, then applying the appropriate emission factor for the mode used 
- Spend-based method, which involves determining the amount of money spent on each mode of business travel transport and applying secondary (EEIO) emission factors.
