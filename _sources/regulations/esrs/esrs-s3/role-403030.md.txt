26. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the formal means by which affected communities can make their concerns and needs known directly to the undertaking, and/or through which the undertaking supports the availability of such channels (for example, grievance mechanisms) by its business relationships, how follow up is performed with these communities regarding the issues raised, and the effectiveness of these channels.

27. The undertaking shall describe: 

	- (a) its general approach to and processes for providing or contributing to remedy where it has identified that it has caused or contributed to a material negative impact on affected communities, including whether and how the undertaking assesses that the remedy provided is effective;

	- (b) any specific channels it has in place for affected communities to raise their concerns or needs directly with the undertaking and have them addressed, including whether these are established by the undertaking itself and/or through participation in third-party mechanisms;

The undertaking shall disclose whether and how it assesses that affected communities are aware of and trust these structures or processes as a way to raise their concerns or needs and have them addressed. In addition, the undertaking shall disclose whether it has policies in place regarding the protection of individuals that use them against retaliation. If such information has been disclosed in accordance with ESRS G1-1, the undertaking may refer to that information.

29. If the undertaking cannot disclose the above required information because it has not adopted a channel for raising concerns and/or does not support the availability of such a channel by its business relationships, it shall disclose this to be the case. It may disclose a timeframe in which it aims to have such a channel or processes in place.
