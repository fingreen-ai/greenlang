## Disclosure Requirement S3-2 – Processes for engaging with affected communities about impacts

19. The undertaking shall disclose its general processes for engaging with affected communities and their representatives about actual and potential impacts on them.

20. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of whether and how the undertaking engages, as part of its ongoing due diligence process, with affected communities, their legitimate representatives, or with credible proxies, about material actual and potential positive and/or negative impacts that do or are likely to affect them, and whether and how perspectives of affected communities are taken into account in the decision-making processes of the undertaking.

21. The undertaking shall disclose whether and how the perspectives of affected communities inform its decisions or activities aimed at managing actual and potential impacts on communities. This shall include, where relevant, an explanation of:

	- (a) whether engagement occurs with affected communities or their legitimate representatives directly, or with credible proxies that have insight into their situation;
	- (b) the stage	- (s) at which engagement occurs, the type of engagement, and the frequency of the engagement;
	- (c) the function and the most senior role within the undertaking that has operational responsibility for ensuring this engagement happens, and that the results inform the undertaking’s approach;
	- (d) where applicable, how the undertaking assesses the effectiveness of its engagement with affected communities, including, where relevant, any agreements or outcomes that result.

22. Where applicable, the undertaking shall disclose the steps it takes to gain insight into the perspectives of affected communities that may be particularly vulnerable to impacts and/or marginalized, and into the perspective of specific groups within the affected communities, such as women and girls.

23. Where affected communities are indigenous peoples, the undertaking shall also disclose how it takes into account and ensures respect of their particular rights in its stakeholder engagement approach, including their right to free, prior and informed consent with regard to: 	- (i) their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property; (ii) activities affecting their lands and territories; and (iii) legislative or administrative measures that affect them. In particular, where engagement occurs with indigenous peoples, the undertaking shall also disclose whether and how indigenous peoples have been consulted on the mode and parameters of the engagement (for example, in designing the agenda, nature, and timeliness of the engagement).
