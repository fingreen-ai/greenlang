In addition, the undertaking shall provide the following information:

- (b) In the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either 	- (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the undertaking operates (for example, child labour or forced labour or compulsory labour in specific countries or regions outside the EU), or (ii) related to individual incidents (for example, an industrial accident or an oil spill);
- (c) In the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts, the types of employees and non-employees in its own workforce that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions;

	+ ii. countries or geographic areas with operations considered at risk;
- (g) Operations at significant risk of incidents of child labour (88) either in terms of:

15. In describing the main types of people in its own workforce who are or could be negatively affected, based on the materiality assessment set out in ESRS 2 IRO 1, the undertaking shall disclose whether and how it has developed an understanding of how people with particular characteristics, those working in particular contexts, or those undertaking particular activities may be at greater risk of harm.

16. The undertaking shall disclose which, if any, of its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on people in its own workforce relate to specific groups of people (for example, particular age groups, or people working in a particular factory or country) rather than to all of its own workforce (for example, a general pay cut, or training offered to all people in its own workforce).
