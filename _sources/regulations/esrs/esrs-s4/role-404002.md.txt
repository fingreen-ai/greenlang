		+ ii. consumers and/or end-users of services that potentially negatively impact their rights to privacy, to have their personal data protected, to freedom of expression and to non-discrimination;
		+ iii. consumers and/or end-users who are dependent on accurate and accessible product- or service-related information, such as manuals and product labels, to avoid potentially damaging use of a product or service;
