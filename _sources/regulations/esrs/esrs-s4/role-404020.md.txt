## Disclosure Requirement S4-2 – Processes for engaging with consumers and end-users about impacts

18. The undertaking shall disclose its general processes for engaging with consumers and end-users and their representatives about actual and potential impacts on them.

19. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of whether and how the undertaking engages, as part of its ongoing due diligence process, with consumers and/or end-users, their legitimate representatives, or with credible proxies, about material actual and potential positive and/or negative impacts that do or are likely to affect them, and whether and how perspectives of consumers and/or end-users are taken into account in the decision-making processes of the undertaking.

20. The undertaking shall disclose whether and how the perspectives of consumers and/or end-users inform its decisions or activities aimed at managing actual and potential impacts on consumers and/or end-users. This shall include, where relevant, an explanation of:

	- (a) whether engagement occurs with affected consumers and/or end-users or their legitimate representatives directly, or with credible proxies that have insight into their situation;
	- (b) the stage	- (s) at which engagement occurs, the type of engagement, and the frequency of the engagement;
	- (c) the function and the most senior role within the undertaking that has operational responsibility for ensuring this engagement happens and that the results inform the undertaking’s approach; and
	- (d) where applicable, how the undertaking assesses the effectiveness of its engagement with consumers and/or end-users, and, where relevant, any agreements or outcomes that result from such engagement.

21. Where applicable, the undertaking shall disclose the steps it takes to gain insight into the perspectives of consumers and/or end-users that may be particularly vulnerable to impacts and/or marginalised (for example, people with disabilities, children, etc.).

22. If the undertaking cannot disclose the above required information because it has not adopted a general process to engage with consumers and/or end-users, it shall disclose this to be the case. It may disclose a timeframe in which it aims to have such a process in place.
